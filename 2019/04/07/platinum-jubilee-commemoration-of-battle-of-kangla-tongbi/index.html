<p style="text-align:justify">The position of 221 AOD was not at all sound from a tactical point of view.  It was exposed to the enemy from all sides and had to rely on its own combatant manpower for its defence.  Major Boyd, the Deputy Chief of Ordnance Officer (DCOO) was made in charge of the operations for defence of the Depot.  A Suicide squad comprising of Major Boyd, Havildar/ Clerk Store Basant Singh, Conductor Panken and other personnel from the Depot was created.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">On 06 Apr 1944, orders were received to evacuate 4,000 tons of ammunition, armaments and other warlike stores.  On the night of 6/7 Apr 1944, the Japanese mounted a heavy attack on the Depot, rushing downhill into a deep nallah which was used as a covered approach to the Depot.  A very well camouflaged bunker had been sited by the Depot on this approach.  The Bren Gun Section in this bunker having spotted an enemy section within range, opened fire.  This shook the enemy and forced the Japanese to withdraw leaving many dead.  The Bren Gun was manned by none other than Hav/ Clerk Store Basant Singh.     </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">For this act of gallantry, Major Boyd was awarded the Military Cross (MC), Conductor Panken, the Military Medal (MM) and Hav/ Clerk Store Basant Singh, the Indian Distinguished Service Medal (IDSM).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Kangla Tongbi War Memorial is a mute testimony to this battle and the unflinching devotion to duty of the Ordnance personnel of          221 AOD, 19 of whom made the supreme sacrifice.  It conveys to the world at large that Ordnance personnel, apart from being professional logisticians, are second to none in combat, being equally proficient soldiers, should the occasion demand.  As it commemorate the Platinum Jubilee of this hard fought battle, the spirit of Kangla Tongbi lives eternally in the hearts of all Army Ordnance Corps personnel of the Indian Army and continues to be source of inspiration for all ranks.  </p>
