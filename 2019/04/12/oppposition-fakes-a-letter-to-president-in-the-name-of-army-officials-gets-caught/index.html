The letter contained 61 signatories from the armed forces.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It turned out that President has not received any such letter from Army Veterans.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The alleged signatories of the letter denied that they signed or supported any such letter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The first signatory Ex Army chief Gen Rodrigues denied signing any letter. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Air Marshall Suri said that he never supported any such letter and asserted that he would speak with the rest to verify whether they had actually supported the letter in its current form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">But the damage had already been done. Several journalists including Rajdeep Sardesai, Sagarika Ghose and Bharka Dutt had shared the fake news about the signatories but not the responses by the veterans.</p>
