<p style="text-align:justify">The GSLV Programme &#8211; Phase 4 will enable the launch of 2 tonne class of satellites for Geo-imaging, Navigation, Data Relay Communication and Space Sciences. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Financial implications:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The total fund requirement is Rs. 2729.13 Crores and includes the cost of five GSLV vehicles, essential facility augmentation, Programme Management, and Launch Campaign along with the additional funds required for meeting the scope of the ongoing GSLV Continuation Programme.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Benefits:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The GSLV Continuation Programme &#8211; Phase 4 will meet the launch requirement of satellites for providing critical Satellite Navigation Services, Data Relay Communication for supporting the Indian Human spaceflight programme and the next interplanetary mission to Mars. This will also ensure the continuity of production in Indian industry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Implementation Strategy and targets:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The GSLV Continuation Programme &#8211; Phase 4 will meet the demand for the launch of satellites at a frequency up to two launches per year, with maximal participation by the Indian industry. All the operational flights would be completed during the period 2021-24.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Major impact:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The operationalization of GSLV has made the country self-reliant in the launching capability of 2 tonne class of satellites for communication &#038; meteorological satellites. The GSLV Continuation Programme will sustain &#038; strengthen the capability and self-reliance in the launching of similar satellites for national requirements including next generation navigation satellites, data relay communication satellites and interplanetary missions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Background:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">GSLV has enabled independent access to space for 2 tonne class of satellites to Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO). One of the very significant outcomes of the GSLV Continuation Programme is the mastering of the highly complex cryogenic propulsion technology, which is an essential technological capability to launch communication satellites to GTO. This has also paved the way for the development of a high thrust Cryogenic engine &#038; stage for the next generation launch vehicle i.e. GSLV Mk-lll.   </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">With the recent successful launch of GSLV-F11 on 19th December 2018, GSLV has successfully orbited 10 national satellites. GSLV with the indigenous Cryogenic Upper Stage has established itself as a reliable launch vehicle for communication, navigation and meteorological satellites and also to undertake future interplanetary missions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">GSLV Continuation Programme was initially sanctioned in 2003, and two phases have been completed and the third phase is in progress and expected to be completed by Q4 of 2020-21.   </p>
