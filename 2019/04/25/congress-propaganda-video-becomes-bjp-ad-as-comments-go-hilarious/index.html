The ad would be shown nationwide for next 24 hours on youtube. The video itself was just of 27 seconds and did not contain any matter of public interest. The IT Cell had disabled like/Dislike button which is generally done to avoid negative publicity. But the comment section was open for public. People across the country made hilarious comments which at the end converted ad as a pro-BJP ad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">One of the comment said &#8220;Congress will never pay for youtube ad after reading the comments&#8221;. Which almost said what the comment contained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Read them yourself below before the Congress IT cell deletes them from the comment section.</p>
