These include revamping of old Acts, easing of norms for Coastal Shipping, quality training and employment of seafarers and complete revamp of e-Governance modules. There have been reforms in Training and Seafarer’s welfare systems, introduction of  e- migrant and ISPL module in e-governance system ensuring maritime administration to be in the loop. The steps taken in the recent years have had significant impact on seafarers&#8217; employment whose numbers have gone up substantially touching a figure of 2,08,000. The Ship registration in India has gone up by around 200 in the last 4 years and coastal traffic is expected to rise significantly.
