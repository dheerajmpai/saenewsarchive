DBT has started the UMMID Initiative which</span> is designed on the concept of ‘Prevention is better than Cure’. <span style="background-color:white">In India’s urban areas, congenital malformations and genetic disorders are the third most common cause of mortality in newborns. With a very large population and high birth rate, and consanguineous marriage favored in many communities, prevalence of genetic disorders is high in India, the UMMID initiative aims (i) to establish NIDAN Kendras to provide counselling, prenatal testing and diagnosis, management, and multidisciplinary care in Government Hospitals wherein the influx of patients is more, (ii) to produce skilled clinicians in Human Genetics, and (iii) to undertake screening of pregnant women and new born babies for inherited genetic diseases in hospitals at aspirational districts.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">As a part of this initiative, in the first phase, five NIDAN Kendras have been established to provide comprehensive clinical care.</span></span></p>

Screening of 10,000 pregnant women and 5000 new born babies per year for inherited genetic diseases will be taken up at the following seven aspirational districts.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/164.100.117.97/WriteReadData/userfiles/image/image004N73J.jpg?w=696" style="height:320px; width:320px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></span></span></p>
