They must emphasize on teamwork and take everybody along and recognize everybody’s contribution. And while they do so, they must lead and be a role-model. They must also encourage greater people’s participation in socio-economic programmes, especially where they are dealing with mindsets and attitudes. He said that administration is no more about “us” and “them”, but only about “us” and “us together”. The gap between government and people must go. He said that officers’ approach should be people-sensitive and people-centric. We are duty bound to enhance “Ease of Living” for our people.</span></span></span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#000000"> </span></span></span></span></p>
