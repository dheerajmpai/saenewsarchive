The report will assess the connection between short to medium-term actions and their compatibility with the long-term temperature goal in the Paris Agreement. It will assess mitigation options in sectors such as energy, agriculture, forestry and land use, buildings, transport and industry.</span></span></p>

It will be released in time to inform the 2023 global stock take by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) when countries will review progress towards the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global warming to well below 2°C while pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5°C.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The IPCC is the UN body for assessing the science related to climate change. It was established by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1988 to provide political leaders with periodic scientific assessments concerning climate change, its implications and risks, as well as to put forward adaptation and mitigation strategies. It has 195 member states.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Thousands of people from all over the world contribute to the work of the IPCC. For the assessment reports, IPCC scientists volunteer their time to assess the thousands of scientific papers published each year to provide a comprehensive summary of what is known about the drivers of climate change, its impacts and future risks, and how adaptation and mitigation can reduce those risks.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The IPCC has three working groups: Working Group I, dealing with the physical science basis of climate change; Working Group II, dealing with impacts, adaptation and vulnerability; and Working Group III, dealing with the mitigation of climate change. It also has a Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories that develops methodologies for measuring emissions and removals.</span></span></p>
