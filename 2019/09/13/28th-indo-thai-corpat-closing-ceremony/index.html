<p style="text-align:justify">Indian Naval assets have been increasingly deployed in recent times to address the main maritime concerns of the region. In addition, the Indian Navy has also been involved in assisting countries in the Indian Ocean Region with EEZ Surveillance, Search and Rescue and other capacity-building and capability-enhancement activities. The current deployment is in consonance with Indian Navy’s efforts to consolidate     inter-operability and forge strong bonds of friendship across the seas. </p>
