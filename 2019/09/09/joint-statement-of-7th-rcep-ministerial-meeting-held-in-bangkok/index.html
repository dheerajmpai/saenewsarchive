The Meeting was chaired by Jurin Laksanawisit, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Commerce of Thailand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Ministers recognised that negotiations have reached a critical milestone as the deadline for the conclusion of negotiations draws near. Notwithstanding the remaining challenges in the negotiations, RPCs are working on addressing outstanding issues that are fundamental to conclude the agreement this year as mandated by the Leaders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Continuing uncertainties in trade and investment environment have dampened growth outlook across the world, with likely impact on businesses and jobs, adding to the urgency and imperative of concluding the RCEP. While noting that certain developments in the global trade environment may affect RPC’s individual positions in the course of the negotiations, Ministers agreed that RPCs should not lose the long-term vision of deepening and expanding the values chains in the RCEP. The Ministers underscored that, successfully concluded, the RCEP will provide the much-needed stability and certainty to the market, which will in turn boost trade and investment in the region. To this end, Ministers reaffirmed their collective resolve to bring negotiations to a conclusion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Ministers committed to avail negotiators with the necessary resources and mandate to bring negotiations to a close. The Ministers made the collective call to negotiators at all levels to translate this commitment into constructive actions and positive outcomes.</p>
