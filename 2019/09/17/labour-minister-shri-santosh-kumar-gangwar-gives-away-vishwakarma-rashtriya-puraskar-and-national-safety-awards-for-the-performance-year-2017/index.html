We as a nation want to enable healthy, active lives through our skills and knowledge, while also seeking reasonable limits to potential harms that ensure these lives can be lived unhindered, and unburdened by fatal and life-changing accidents. These awards stimulate and sustain the interest of both management and workers alike in accident prevention and safety promotional programmes. </p>
