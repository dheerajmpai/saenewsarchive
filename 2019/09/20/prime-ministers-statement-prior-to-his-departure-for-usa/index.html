I will visit Houston and, thereafter, New York to attend the High Level Segment of the 74th Session of the United Nations General Assembly.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">In Houston, I will interact with CEOs of leading energy companies in the US with the aim to enhance India-US energy partnership. Energy has emerged as a new area of mutually beneficial cooperation and is fast becoming an important facet of our bilateral relationship.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">In Houston, I look forward to my meeting with and address to the Indian-American community. Their success in diverse fields, their contribution to the US in various walks of life, their strong bonds with India and their role as a living bridge between our two democracies is a source of pride for us. It is a matter of great honour for the Indian diaspora and pleasure for me that President of the United States Mr. Donald Trump will grace the occasion with his presence and join me in addressing the community. This would be a maiden appearance of US President in an Indian community event with me, and marks a new milestone in our outreach to them.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">While in Houston, I will also have the opportunity to interact with various groups of the Indian-American community and their elected representatives.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">In New York, I will participate in various major events in the United Nations. Since its participation as a founding member of the United Nations in 1945, India has shown unwavering commitment to multilateralism to advance peace and security and promote broad-based inclusive economic growth and development in the world.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">This year, the 74th session of the UN General Assembly has the theme “Galvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion”. There are many pressing challenges for the international community – a still fragile global economy, turbulence and tension in many parts of the world, growth and spread of terrorism, climate change and the endemic global challenge of poverty. They require stronger global commitment and concerted multilateral action. I will reiterate our commitment to reformed multilateralism, which is responsive, effective and inclusive, and in which India plays her due role.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Through my participation in UN events, I will showcase our success in realizing the Sustainable Development Goals. At the Climate Action Summit on 23rd September, I will highlight India’s robust action to address climate change in line with global goals and our international commitments.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">At the UN event on Universal Health Coverage, similarly, I look forward to sharing on the world stage India’s achievements in providing healthcare for the needy through many initiatives, including the Ayushman Bharat programme.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">India will also host at the UN an event to celebrate the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, which will underline the continuing relevance of Gandhian thoughts and values in today’s world. Several Heads of State and Government along with UN Secretary General will grace the occasion to pay our collective tribute to Gandhiji and underscore the significance of his message.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">I will also hold bilateral meetings with leaders from other countries and UN entities on the margins of the UNGA. For the first time, India will hold leadership level interactions with the leaders of the Pacific Island States, and leaders of the CARICOM group on the margins of UNGA. This will take forward our vibrant South-South cooperation and partnership with them.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">I look forward to meeting President Trump in Houston and New York in a span of a few days. We will review our bilateral relations in order to bring even more benefits to our two nations and peoples. The US is a vital partner for our national development, with rich possibilities of partnership in education, skills, research, technology and innovation, and an enabler for India in economic growth and national security. Shared values, convergent interests and complementary strengths provide the foundation for natural partnership between the world&#8217;s oldest and largest democracies. Working together, we can contribute to building a more peaceful, stable, secure, sustainable and prosperous world.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">The New York leg of my visit will also cover important elements of our bilateral relations with the US. I look forward to addressing the opening plenary of the Bloomberg Global Business Forum and inviting American business leaders to participate more actively in India&#8217;s economic growth and transformation. I am honoured by the decision of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to confer upon me the Global Goalkeepers Goals Award 2019.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">I am confident that my visit would present India as a vibrant land of opportunities, a reliable partner and a global leader, and will also help impart new energy to our relations with the US.</span></span></p>
