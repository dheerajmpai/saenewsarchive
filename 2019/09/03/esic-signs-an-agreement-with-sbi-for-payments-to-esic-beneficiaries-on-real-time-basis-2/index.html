<p style="text-align:justify">The e-payment integration would effect statutory benefit payments to ESIC beneficiaries as well as other payees on real time basis, reducing time lags and delays and at the same time, help to eliminate mistakes and errors caused by repetitive and manual data entries. The new system will benefit all stakeholders of ESIC. The agreement was signed in the presence of Shri Rajkumar, DG, ESIC and Shri Sunil Wadhera, DGM, SBI.</p>
