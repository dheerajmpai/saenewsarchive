<p style="text-align:justify">Government has devised a multi- pronged approach for providing boost to the economy. Merger of some Public Sector Banks and upfront capital infusion of Rs. 70.000 crore were announced recently. It is hoped that enhanced credit flow will spur investment cycle and help revive stressed sectors like housing. Start-ups have been exempted from ‘angel tax’. Distress in the auto sector has also been addressed through a package of measures. </p>
