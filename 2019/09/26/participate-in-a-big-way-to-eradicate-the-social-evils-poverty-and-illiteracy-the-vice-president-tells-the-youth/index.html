Venkaiah Naidu has urged youth to participate in a big way to eradicate social evils, poverty, and illiteracy. He also asked them to be in the forefront in eliminating casteism and religious fundamentalism.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">Delivering the first Prof. Yashwantrao Kelkar Memorial Lecture, in Mumbai today, he pointed out that the country was facing challenges on different fronts &#8211; about 20 percent of the population was still living in poverty and an equal percentage of people were illiterate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">Shri Naidu cited instances of social, gender discrimination and atrocities against women, corruption, casteism and religious fundamentalism as some of the challenges. On the external front, India was constantly facing the problem of cross-border terrorism, he added.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">Stressing the need for promoting nationalistic outlook among the youth and involving them in constructive nation-building activities, he said: “All of us must strive to build a New India that is free of poverty, hunger, discrimination, and inequalities based on caste, creed, and gender”.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">Shri Naidu advised student organizations such as Vidyarthi Parishad to instill the feeling of ‘nation first’ among the youth and encourage them to actively participate in national development. He called upon the youth to work with a missionary zeal and determination to transform India into a prosperous and happy nation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">Stating that India has a great demographic dividend with more than 65% of its population below the age of 35 years, the Vice President stressed the need to impart knowledge and skills to youth for effectively meeting the challenges of technology-driven the 21st century.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">Observing that this was the age of innovation, incubation, and start-ups, he called for tapping the entrepreneurial potential among the youth of the country.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">Stating that changing the face of our rural and backward villages was essential for inclusive development, the Vice President said that the critical challenge was to deploy the best possible ideas in the innovation-led development of the rural areas of the nation, where 60 percent of its population lives.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">Describing the urban-rural divide in the country as a challenge, Shri Naidu called for planned and systematic initiatives to revive the rural economy. He stressed the need to strengthen the rural economy by empowering rural artisans, farmers and women.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">Stating that advancement in technology, expansion of new and modern healthcare facilities provide an opportunity to address urban-rural divide, the Vice President said that there was an urgent need to make agriculture more sustainable and profitable.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">Shri Naidu also called for a people’s movement to conserve water resources, ensure a sustainable  development and maintain the ecological balance. He said that climate change was real and affecting all species on the planet.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">The Governor of Maharashtra, Shri Bhagat Singh Koshyari, the Minister-in-waiting, Shri Vinod Tawde, the Chairman, Piramal Group &amp; Shriram Group, Shri Ajay Piramal, the National Organizing Secretary, ABVP, Shri Sunil Ambedkar, the National General Secretary, ABVP, Shri Ashish Chauhan and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px"><u>Following is the text of Vice President&#8217;s address</u>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">&#8220;I express my gratitude to the organizers for having invited me to deliver the first Prof. Yashwantrao Kelkar memorial lecture.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">I recollect him as a selfless, simple, affable, affectionate and a caring individual. He was a friend philosopher and guide to many people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">Yashwantrao was a man of high intellect, knowledge and great qualities of head and heart and it was impossible for anyone who came in contact with him to remain untouched by his illumination.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">One of his great qualities was the immediate connect he used to establish with the younger generation. He always used to have animated discussions with them and believed in instilling samskara and nation first attitude. He used to stress on sharpening the intellect of the youth and involving them in nation-building activities. He had inspired and shaped thousands of students to work selflessly for the country throughout their lifetime.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">He was the main architect of ABVP and he conceptualized, designed and successfully implemented a unique working methodology of ABVP.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">The important organizational principles he believed in are &#8211;planning in advance and planning in detail; Everybody is important but nobody is indispensable;  Each one is incomplete but when many such incomplete individuals come together, they form a whole; Teamwork is the essence of an organization.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">He used to say that we are human beings and not machines. We can make mistakes, so accept everyone as he is, but develop him as we want him to be.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">These are the principles he inculcated in ABVP and had thus built a strong, vibrant, forward-looking, sensitive and nationalistic student’s organization.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">He gave purpose and goal to the life of thousands of students and youth and made them participate in all walks of life with nation-first attitude. The Indian philosophy with its unique definition of the relationship between individual, society, nature, creation and the creator and its distinct concept of human happiness provides the basis for meeting the multi-pronged challenges faced by the world community today.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">Dear Friends,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">India is an ancient civilization and always believed in the philosophy of Vasudhaika Kutumbakam. India was the knowledge hub in ancient times and was known as ‘Vishwaguru’. World famous learning centres like Nalanda, Pushpagiri and Takshshila attracted scholars and knowledge seekers from far and wide.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">Although, India was a flourishing trading centre and contributed up to 25 per cent of the world GDP some centuries ago, we never attacked anybody or entertained designs to conquer an alien territory. We always believed in peaceful co-existence with all, including our neighbours. Our country has achieved great heights by enlightening the world with its intellectual and spiritual wisdom. From zero to yoga, India has made numerous contributions to the enrichment of the world’s intellectual and spiritual progress.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">While taking pride in our accomplishments and achievements from ancient times till now, we all should strive to preserve, protect and promote India’s rich culture, traditions, values and ethos. A corollary of the concept of seeing the whole world as one family is the attitude of empathy, of sharing and caring, of a sharp focus on alleviating the agony of fellow human beings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">There is a need to promote nationalistic outlook among the youth and involve them in constructive nation-building activities. All of us must strive to build a New India that is free of poverty, hunger, discrimination and inequalities based on caste, creed and gender.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">Student organizations such as Vidyarthi Parishad must instill the feeling of ‘nation first’ among the youth and encourage them to actively participate in national development.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">We have a great demographic dividend and more than 65% of our population is young. We need to impart knowledge and skills to our youth for effectively meeting the challenges of technology-driven the 21st century. This is the age of innovation, incubation and start-ups and we must fully tap the entrepreneurial potential among the youth of the country.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">Dear youngsters,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">Even 70 years after Independence, the country is facing  challenges on different fronts—about 20 per cent of the population is still living in poverty and an equal percentage of people are not literate; instances of social, gender discrimination and atrocities against women are happening now and then; then there is the canker of corruption; casteism and religious fundamentalism. On the external front, India is constantly facing the problem of cross-border terrorism.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">One of the most glaring challenges is the urban-rural divide. With the advancement in technology, expansion of new and modern healthcare facilities, we have a tremendous opportunity to bridge the gap between urban and rural areas. Planned and systematic initiatives are needed to revive the rural economy. For that to happen, there is an urgent need to make agriculture more sustainable and profitable.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">As you all are aware, the village economy relies mostly on agriculture, while the cities and urban centers have seen a growth led by services and manufacturing sectors.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">We need to create economic avenues for rural artisans, farmers, women, and the youth by ensuring education and empowering them to use technology.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">The critical challenge is to deploy the best possible ideas in the innovation-led development of the rural areas of the nation, where 60 percent of its population lives. Changing the face of our rural and backward villages is an essential component of inclusive development.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">It is extremely important for the youth to participate in a big way to eradicate the social evils, poverty and illiteracy. They also should be in the forefront of eliminating casteism and religious fundamentalism. In spite of the challenges, India is marching ahead in various fields from space exploration to sports with our men and women bringing laurels and global recognition to our country.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">As mentioned earlier, we need to fully tap the youthful energy into fast-tracking the nation’s progress and make India a five trillion dollar economy in the coming years. Young India’s aspirations and their united efforts would determine the future of the country.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>Another important issue that I have been flagging often is the need to completely overhaul the education system to prepare students to effectively face the challenges of the 21st century. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>We need an education system that transforms a student to become a complete human being, who is sensitive to the needs of others, understands the other point of view and respects and values others for what they are.</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>We need to revamp the education system and reorient the curriculum to suit the needs of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, while upholding the Indian values and ethos at the same time. I have also been advocating that education should inculcate morals, ethics, empathy, sensitivity and respect for women and elders. The New Education Policy must focus more on incorporating a complete and comprehensive history of India, apart from our rich culture and heritage.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>There is also a need to make it education more equitable and inclusive. Policy makers and the educationists must ensure that every child receives holistic education.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>India should once again become a Vishwaguru and the hub of innovation and knowledge. For that to happen, we have to drastically revamp the education system to make our institutions of higher learning and universities the centres of excellence with international standards.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">Dear youngsters, I would also like you to be in the forefront of protecting our natural resources.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">As you all are aware, climate change is real and affecting all species on the planet.  For long, we have tinkered with nature and it is showing its fury on us. I feel that a people’s movement is needed to conserve water resources, ensure a sustainable model of development and maintain the ecological balance. Protect nature and preserve culture for a better future.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">Before concluding, I call upon the youth to work with a missionary zeal and determination to transform India into a prosperous and happy nation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>JAI HIND!</strong></span></p>
