<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:black">Speaking on the occasion, Dr. Singh said that there are many unexplored potentials in North East and one of them is bamboo, as more than 50% of India’s bamboos are found in this region. The Minister further said though the biggest storehouse of bamboo in India is North East, the market of bamboo is extended all over India. Now it is up to us how we utilize it, what we produce, how much and how far can we reach, where we can capture market and how it can also become the source of livelihood for the youth, he added. Dr. Singh urged the youth of the region to utilize the home grown bamboo to produce different commodities which will help them to earn their livelihood sitting at home.  And for this purpose, with the help of the North Eastern Council (NEC) and other organizations, Ministry of DoNER would be always there to help them to facilitate their marketing beyond North East, the Minister further added. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:black">Talking about the importance of creating awareness about the benefits of bamboo industry, Dr. Singh said that there is no dearth of takers or buyers for our products; the only problem is that they do not know what we are producing. What is important is creating awareness, for which simultaneously the Ministry has started a campaign across the country, he said. </span></span></p>
