<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">According to the 5th Employment Un-employment survey of Labour Bureau 2015-16, Sikkim has second highest unemployment rate of 18.1 per cent (after Tripura). High per capita income and good share of secondary sector in GSDP is paradoxical to the high unemployment rate hinting towards jobless growth.</span></span></p>

However, NTR has declined significantly in last few years due to fall in revenues from lottery. It has a trend growth rate of (-10.9%) from 2011 to 2018. State has potential to increase its earnings through Hydro-power sector and tourism which should be explored.</span></span></p>

Also, 15% of the consumers were not metered as on 31.03.2017.  AT&amp;C losses are about 33% and ACS-ARR gap is 6.93 which is extremely high (M/o Power)State Government should take steps to corporatize and unbundle the power department and allow it to run on sound economic principles.</span></span></p>
