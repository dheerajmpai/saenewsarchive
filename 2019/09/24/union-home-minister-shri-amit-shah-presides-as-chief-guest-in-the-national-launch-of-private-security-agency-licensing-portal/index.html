<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:18px">The Home Minister said that the online portal would be useful in ensuring transparency in licensing in this sector and would give a boost to its credibility. He said that with the online availability of credentials, it would become easier for an agency registered in one state to expand its operations in another state. He further assured that the portal will be available in all official Indian languages in next 90 days and said that such facilitation would give a pan-India profile to the online licensing process.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:18px">Shri Shah observed that as majority of police stations across the country are connected online, the online police verification of security guards would become very easy by accessing the criminal records online from across the country. He appealed to the private security industry to join the government and start awareness campaigns to make people aware in encouraging only license holder agencies in the sector.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:18px">Shri Shah also said that retired paramilitary and military personnel represent the untapped potential of the sector and agencies should try to recruit people who have undergone at least NCC training. This would ensure basic discipline in the employees. This assumes importance because private security personnel are the first line of responders against criminals in the society. Thus, Shri Shah said, there is a need to impart Indian Penal Code related knowledge to them during their training itself. He added that private security personnel must maintain regular contact with the nearest police station and act as a connector between police and public.</span></span></p>
