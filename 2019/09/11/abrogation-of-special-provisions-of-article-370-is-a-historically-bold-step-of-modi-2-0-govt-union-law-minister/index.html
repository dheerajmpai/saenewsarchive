<p style="text-align:justify">Allaying the fears of economic slowdown, the Union Minister categorically said that the fundamentals of Indian growth story are intact so the declining of GDP in the first quarter to 5% is certainly not a sign of overall disappointment. He added that the Central Government and the State Governments are taking multifold actions to protect the economy from worldwide recession and at the same time give an impetus to development through various measures such as credit expansion by PSBs, merger of PSBs and relaxing the norms for NBFCs. Mr Prasad said that a temporary slowdown will be checked by multidimensional pro-development efforts which will not only generate large scale employment but will also ensure enhanced private sector investment in sectors such as agro-processing, real estate and construction and other manufacturing sectors. Replying to a question, the Union Minister said that the people of Jammu and Kashmir are well aware of the benefits of the Government’s action to abrogate various provisions of Article 370 and abolition of 35A. Lambasting Pakistan for gross human rights violations in PoK, the Minister asserted that if any talks in terror free atmosphere with Pakistan will be held that will be on PoK. Showering praise on the leadership of the PM, Shri Narendra Modi, he said that the decisiveness of leadership has provided clear directions for inclusive development of the nation as a whole.
