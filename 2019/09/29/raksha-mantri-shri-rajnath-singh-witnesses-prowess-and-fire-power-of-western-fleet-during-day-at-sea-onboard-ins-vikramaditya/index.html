After witnessing the prowess and fire power of the Western Fleet first hand, Raksha Mantri said, “I am most impressed to see the professionalism, commitment and spirited approach shown by the brave sailors of the Indian Navy. I am reassured that the security of our nation is in safe hands”.</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:#000000"> </span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:#000000">            Emphasising that security of India relies a lot on being strong at sea, Shri Rajnath Singh lauded the multi-dimensional approach adopted by the Navy to ensure safety and security in the country’s areas of maritime interest. He said, the Navy’s Mission Based Deployments at critical regions of the Indian Ocean have strengthened the maritime security environment in the region.</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:#000000"> </span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:#000000">            Raksha Mantri also commended the Western Fleet which was immediately deployed in a strong posture in the northern Arabian Sea when the Government effectively responded to the Pulwama attacks through strikes on terror camps in Balakot. He said, “Western Fleet degraded the ability of our adversary and ensured they did not attempt any misadventure at sea”. Shri Rajnath Singh termed as most significant the role of Indian Navy to have a credible “second strike” capability as a Nuclear deterrent.</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:#000000"> </span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:#000000">            Saying that Indian Naval ships are continuously deployed for anti-piracy operations, Raksha Mantri commended the Navy for demonstrating and re-affirming its role as a Net Security Provider in the Indian Ocean Region. He said, the Navy has been able to achieve credible deterrence by maintaining a very high degree of preparedness through regular training, quality maintenance and strategic situational awareness. He also termed naval deployments as an important tool of diplomacy which is essential to build bonds with friendly nations.</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:#000000"> </span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:#000000">Describing Navy as the key enabler and guarantor of the India’s maritime security, Raksha Mantri said, India’s economic resurgence is directly linked to its overseas trade and energy needs, most of which is by sea. “About 90 percent of India&#8217;s international trade by volume and about 70 percent by value are carried by sea. As we move towards our goal of 5 trillion dollar economy; the volume of maritime trade will only grow in times to come. Thus, I firmly believe that the role of the Indian Navy in general and the Western Fleet in particular is also critical in ensuring the energy security and economic growth of the country”, he added.</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:#000000"> </span></span></span></p>
