He said that the priority of the Government is to provide transparent and citizen-centric governance to the people. He was addressing at the launch of Centralised Public Grievances Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) reforms in Department of Posts, at a function organised by Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, here today.

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="color:black">Dr Jitendra Singh said that the new version of CPGRAMS will lead to reduction in grievance disposal time and improved quality of grievance redressal. The Minister also mentioned about the monthly “Pragati” (Pro Active Governance and Timely Implementation) review meetings where the Prime Minister himself reviews the status of public grievances. He mentioned about various other initiatives such as amendment in Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. He said that DARPG holds regular regional conferences and also the national e-Governance conferences. He further added though Grievance redressal mechanism existed in the past also, yet it was not as proactive and responsive as it is now. The mechanism has been institutionalised now with the number of grievances lodged increasing from 2 lakh earlier to about 16 lakhs now. This increase is due to the trust shown by people of the country in the grievance redressal mechanism of the Government, the Minister said. Dr Jitendra Singh said that the telephonic calls are made by the senior officers of the Department to the complainants to take their feedback about their satisfaction level. He said that the decision of the Government to post young IAS officers as Assistant Secretaries in the Central Ministries/departments for a period of 3 months has proved to be beneficial for the young recruits to understand the functioning the Government in the very beginning of their careers.</span></span></span></p>

As per the amended Rule, the family of a Government servant, who dies within seven years of joining service, will also be eligible for family pension at enhanced rate of 50% of last pay drawn, for a period of 10 years. The Minister said that this reform is one of the citizen-centric reforms in the first 100 days of Modi Government’s second term.
