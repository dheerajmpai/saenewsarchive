<p style="text-align:justify">Following the announcement on 23rd August 2019, banks have already entered into 14 tie-ups with NBFCs for co-originating loans, with another 36 such tie-ups in the pipeline.

<p style="text-align:justify">Further, to enable automatic transmission of externally benchmarked rates, 15 Public Sector Banks have already introduced Repo-rate-linked loan products for housing and vehicles, consumer credit, cash credit limits and mortgage-based loans. Already, over 1.08 lakh Repo-linked proposals, amounting to over Rs. 40,000 crore, have been sanctioned. The remaining three Public Sector Banks will also be introducing such products by 1st October. These measures are aimed at considerable improvement in access to affordable credit.</p>

This will instill a sense of protection among bankers from prosecution for genuine decisions and promote lending and Public Sector Bank heads expressed their resolve to take prudent commercial decision without any fear now.</p>
