The ships are part of the Indian Navy&#8217;s Eastern Naval Command under the Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Eastern Naval Command, based at Visakhapatnam. The port call is a demonstration of India&#8217;s warm ties with Malaysia. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">IN Ships Sahyadri and Kiltan, operating under the Command of Rear Admiral Suraj Berry, Flag Officer Commanding Eastern Fleet, are the latest, indigenously designed and built multi-role ships of the Indian Navy. The two ships are equipped with a versatile array of weapons and sensors, can carry multi-role helicopters and represent the ‘coming of age’ of India’s warship building capabilities. </p>
