Shri Rajnath Singh said due impetus has been given for timely acquisition of state-of-the-art weapons, sensors and platforms, adding that the Government has given more freedom and support to armed forces to take decisions in the nation’s interest. “We are committed to far-reaching changes in our defence preparedness”, he said.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:#222222">“You cannot buy a confident Navy. A confident Navy is always built by a confident Government”, Raksha Mantri said, adding that the Indian Navy has the confidence which no other country in the Indian Ocean possesses.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:#222222">Shri Rajnath Singh urged not just the security forces, but every citizen of the country to stay alert and united to meet any future challenges. “We have to be on the guard against state and non-state actors from across the border”, he said.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:#222222">Underlining the importance of Oceans in development trajectory of a nation, Raksha Mantri said, oceans are gateway of opportunities as well as grave threats if the maritime forces are not alert. He said, the Indian Navy should be the last men standing in the Indian Ocean Region. “We need to safeguard the sea lanes of Indian Ocean to maintain and promote peace &amp; trade in the region.

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:#222222">Shri Rajnath Singh said the nation can never forget the exceptional role it played in 1971 war when Operation Trident and Operation Python broke the backbone of Pakistan Navy.

He said it is a matter of great pride that India is one of the few countries capable of constructing their own Submarine.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:#222222">Raksha Mantri said construction of submarines not only benefits the industry, but also helps evolve a positive culture of stringent quality control and complex engineering. “It brings plough-back benefits for the economy of the nation at large with significant contributions towards ‘Make in India’”, he added.</span></span></span></p>

He was one of the first Indian ruler in medieval era to recognise importance of strong Navy. Commissioning of INS Khanderi will bring same valour and sharpness back on sea.”, Shri Rajnath Singh said.</span></span></span></p>
