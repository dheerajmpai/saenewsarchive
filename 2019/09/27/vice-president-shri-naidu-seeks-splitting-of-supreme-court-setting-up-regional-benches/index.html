Venkaiah Naidu has suggested several reforms including bifurcation of the Supreme Court  and setting up of four Regional Benches of the Apex Court besides evolving Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that limit the number of adjournments and the timeframe for disposal of cases by the courts. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            Shri Naidu spoke at length on the present state of judicial system in the country and the pressing need for  reforms  in the presence of Supreme Court Judge Justice Rohinton F. Nariman, Attorney General of India Shri K.K. Venugopal, several former judges including Justice A.R. Dave and senior advocates like Shri Salman Khurshid, Shri Rajiv Dhawan, Smt. Mahalakshmi Pavani after releasing of book ‘Parameswara to PP’, a compilation of articles of former senior advocate of the Supreme Court late Shri Pavani Parameswara  Rao (P.P. Rao). </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            Shri Venkaiah Naidu strong endorsed the recommendation of the Law Commission towards splitting the Supreme Court into Constitutional Division and Courts of Appeal for steady disposal of cases. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            Shri Naidu also underlined the need to set up four Regional Benches of the apex court and went to the extent of saying that this arrangement does not require any amendment to the Constitution. He recalled that Article 130 of the Constitution which says: “The Supreme Court shall sit in Delhi or in such other place or places, as the Chief Justice of India may, with the approval of the President, from time to time appoint.”  Shri Naidu also referred to a recommendation of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Law and Justice on having Regional Benches of the Supreme Court on trial basis. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            To cut the present delays in delivering justice, Shri Naidu urged that Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) may be evolved by the judiciary  by which the number of permissible adjournments can be specified and a time  limit can be set for disposal of cases based on the nature of issues involved. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            The Vice President urged the Government to be much more proactive in addressing the large number of pending vacancies  in the judicial system so that delays are avoided. He urged the judiciary and the Government to act in tandem in this regard. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            Continuing with his concern over justice delivery, Shri Naidu said; “the speed and quality of justice delivery in the country has a huge bearing on the economic development as it impacts the flow of investment. It would be better if judges at various levels are exposed to special orientation programmes organised by the judiciary itself on various technical and specialised branches of emerging laws and the attendant issues and processes. ”</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            Shri Naidu has called for induction of capable judges and quality lawyers besides improving the quality of legal education to enable delivery of justice in time. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            Shri Naidu who is also the Presiding Officer of Rajya Sabha underscored the need to revisit the Anti-Defection Laws contained in the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution to prevent loopholes and set time limits for the Presiding Officers of various legislatures to decide on defection matters in quick time. He recalled several  instances  of delay in deciding on defection  matters as a result of which those subsequently disqualified have completed their terms in legislatures. He also suggested special judicial tribunals for disposing defection cases within six months to one year. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            The Vice President also underscored the need for election cases and cases of criminal proceedings against politicians to be decided by special benches of higher courts for their disposal within six months. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            Shri Naidu expressed concern over the huge pendency of over 3 crore cases in different courts across the country with some of them pending over for 50 years. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            Shri Naidu hailed former senior Supreme Court advocate Late Shri P.P. Rao as an epitome of “sobriety, balance and equanimity” who never resorted to any histrionics in the court even in extreme situations. He recalled Late Shri P.P. Rao being instrumental in pioneering the instrument of ‘Curative Petition’ by successfully arguing for the right of appeal which was earlier rejected by a seven judge bench of the Supreme Court. “The Principle of Propriety which guided Late Shri P.P. Rao all through his forty year long legal profession and the values of the old world he upheld are worthy of emulation by the present generation ”  Shri Naidu said. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>The following is the full text of the speech:</strong></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Distinguished invitees and friends from media!</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            For me, the release of this book ‘Parameswara to PP’ marks celebration of two sets of values, one of which relates to values held dear all through his professional career  by  a person and the other being the family values which are the most cherished in our society. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            Parliament and Judiciary are among the three pillars of our parliamentary democracy. In respect of Parliament, it is said that Members  rush into the Well of the House when they short on facts.  About the Courts, it is said that lawyers raise their voice when they are short on law. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            Late Shri Pavani Parameswara Rao, widely known as ‘PP’   was bound by a set of values that are usually associated with the ‘Old Word‘ all through his 40 year long career and still emerged as among the best  legal minds of our country. He started his career as a Law teacher earning about Rs. 400 per month and made his way up to earn the same for less than fraction of a second of his time as an impactful lawyer. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            PP was neither flashy nor flamboyant. He did not resort to histrionics in the court when the Bench was not considerate to his point of view. He never raised his voice and was never discourteous to the court. In the words of Shri Abhishek  Manu Singhvi, the defining characteristics of PP were ‘sobriety, balance and equanimity’. PP always shunned vulgarity of speech or conduct and he never trivialised the issues at hand. His advocacy was marked by inherent balance, restraint and genetic gentlemanliness which were manifestation of either inherent inner calm and stability or cultivated by some special form of  meditation. PP always considered the client as ‘annadata’. PP himself wrote in one of his articles in the Book released today that ‘Advocacy is a profession, not business’.  </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            Smt. Mahalakshmi Pavani, PP’s daughter-in-law and the spirit behind the book  revealed that she never got the open support and handholding expected of her influential father-in-law. PP’s mantra to his kith and kin was ‘deserve what you desire and there is no substitute for hard work’. When the delighted Mahalakshmi informed PP that she was designated as senior advocate, PP retorted saying ‘since when it has become so easy’. PP had even supported Mahalakshmi’s opponent for the post of vice president of the Supreme Court Bar Association saying that such an office should be held by a more experienced lawyer. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            In my view, Parameswara became PP by virtue of his unflinching faith in the principle of ‘Power of Propriety’ and he guided by this principle in the pursuit of truth as defined by the laws of the land. Hence, the release of this Book marks the celebration such lofty values and ideals upheld by PP. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            Smt. Mahalakshmi seems to have had a grudge against her father-in-law  for not backing her in the profession to the extent expected. However, this made her what she is today on her own as a senior advocate in the Supreme Court and she can be rightly proud of her accomplishments. This is what perhaps PP desired and  Mahalakshmi conformed to his principle of ‘deserve and desire’.  </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            Despite not getting the open praise or support from her father-in-law, Smt. Mahalakshmi Pavani, out of her respect for the life and legacy of PP took upon herself the responsibility of brining out this Book ‘Parameswara to PP’ containing 48 illuminating articles written by PP besides revealing tributes to him by several legal luminaries.  This book in my view will serve as a useful guide to the practitioners of law and students of law on a range of issues including how to prepare a brief, present a case with proper framing of issues, argue the case with clarity of analysis, conduct oneself in the court and with the fellow professionals. This task undertaken by Smt. Mahalakshmi for the benefit of the posterity, in my view is spurred by the family values of gratitude to the head of the family who instilled the core values and principles of life in his family members.  Hence, release of this book is also a celebration of such values.  </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            My common thread with PP being that he was also graduated from my hometown Nellore. Being in Delhi for long years, I have had some idea about PP’s rise to the top but I got a better peek into his mind and life when I read some of  his articles contained in this Book. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            PP had been associated with quite a few landmark judgements of the apex court that set precedents. I came to know from this book that PP was instrumental in the coming into being  of the instrument of ‘curative petition’ after his forceful and successful articulation of the right to appeal in the A.R. Antulay case. Curative Petition is filed when a Review Petition for correcting a wrong committed by the Court is rejected. He also propounded the  doctrine of ‘Common Thread’ in SR Bommai case besides articulating that secularism is built into the basic structure of our Constitution. The concerned Benches   of the Supreme Court on several occasions went on record appreciating the analysis and presentation of PP in broadening the perspective of interpreting the Constitution and the laws even when he did not win those  cases. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            It is heartening to know that PP was associated  with several landmark cases like the ADM  Jabalpur Vs. Shivkant Shukla Case, Keshawanand Bharati Case, MS Gill Vs. Election Commission Case, SR Bommai Case, JMM Bribery Case, PUCL Case on Voters right to information about antecedents of contesting candidates, Ayodhya case, Best Bakery Case, Entry Tax Case, 2G Spectrum Case etc.  </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            Though PP assisted the then Attorney General Niren De in the ADM Jabalpur Case, he seems to have had some reservations about the extent of amending the Constitution impinging on the fundamental rights of the citizens. Though PP was successful in JMM MPs getting acquitted in the bribery case by strongly arguing for the immunity of the MPs against criminal proceedings, he had a change of heart on seeing the decline in the standard of politics. In one of his articles he wrote and I quote ‘In the prevailing conditions of public morality, I do not think such a privilege is justified’. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            Known for his mild manners and sobriety, PP in his article on ‘Perils of Fearless Democracy’ wrote that “Rules of professional conduct and etiquette require that an Advocate shall present his case fearlessly with due respect to the court”. He, however, recalled as to how he was at the receiving end of a Judge for openly questioning the Judge’s line of interpretation of law. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            After his success in the 2G Spectrum Case, PP had a word of advice for the Court. He wrote that ‘I am of the view that in cases involving far reaching economic consequences affecting the Nation, it would be better for the Court to take the assistance of financial experts in moulding relief appropriately.’</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            After successfully opposing T.N. Seshan’s bid  against multi-member Central Election Commission, PP still has a word of praise for Seshan for making CEC an effective institution and said that Seshan would have been better off without his abrasive ways. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            PP in one of the articles in this book opposed the judgement of Justice late Chinnappa Reddy in reducing death sentence of two naxalites  who shot dead a forest contractor to life terms. Justice Reddy in his judgement wrote and I quote ‘People acting out of genuine and passionate motive according to their conscience, do not merit extreme punishment’.  PP had an issue with this kind of reasoning. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            In the context of the apex court hearing arguments in the Ayodhya Case, it is pertinent to recall what PP had written in one of the articles in this Book on the Presidential reference to the Supreme Court under Article 143(1) of the Constitution for its opinion on the question ‘Whether Hindu temple or any Hindu religious structure existed prior to the construction of the Ram Janm Bhumi – Babri Masjid’. PP wrote and I quote; “All the five Judges unanimously declined to answer the reference made by the President. Had the Constitution Bench answered the Presidential Reference, the dispute which has become a source of frequent communal tensions could have been resolved once and for all. In my turn, I pleaded before the Court and answer it in larger public interest. ”</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            PP had an independent mind and was not a regime lawyer.  He was guided by the principles he believed in and functioned within the boundaries of law and the principles of decorum in the courts.  He was a true representative of the ‘Charm of the old world’ and is worthy of emulation by the present generations. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            Dear Sisters and Brothers,</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">                        After recalling the life and contributions of an eminent legal luminary like PP in the presence of some leading legal minds and others, it would be in order to briefly look at the present state of judiciary in our country. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Over the years, a number of reforms have made our judicial system more robust and responsive. But we have a long way to go. The most urgent judicial reform necessary is the elimination of judicial delays and the improvement of the efficiency of the justice system.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">The government needs to be much more proactive in addressing the large number of pending vacancies in the judicial system so that delays are avoided.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">It is widely known that we have several eminent lawyers and erudite judges in the courts. Still, the justice delivery process is crying for reform to further enhance the faith of the common man in our judiciary by ensuring justice in time and at affordable costs. The huge pendency of courts at various levels totalling over 3 crores is a matter of deep concern. Recently, the Chief Justice of India Justice Ranjan Gogoi stated that over one thousand cases are pending for 50 years and over 2 lakh cases are languishing for 25 years. Out of about 90 lakh pending civil cases, more than 20 lakh are at a stage where summons have not been served at. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            Collectively, judiciary needs to address the issue of delay in the delivery of justice.  Adequate infrastructure in the form of the required number of judges at various levels and the attendant physical infrastructure need to be ensured. There is also a felt need for ensuring capable judges and quality advocates. Immediate attention needs to be paid to the quality of legal education in the country.  Ethical standards of profession should be imbibed by the students of law and the practicing lawyers. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">            The speed and quality of justice delivery in the country has a huge bearing on the economic development as it impacts the flow of investments.   It would be better if Judges at various levels are exposed to special orientation programmes organised by the judiciary itself on various technical and specialised branches of emerging laws and the attendant issues and processes. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">As regards election cases pending before various courts, they need to be disposed of expeditiously.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Election petitions and criminal cases against political leaders must be decided quickly by special benches of higher courts in a time-bound manner. If need be, separate benches may be setup to expedite such cases within six months or one year.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">There are other Judicial and Legislative reforms, I would like to suggest.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">I would like to reiterate that in the cases involving disqualification of member of legislature who change parties, the chairperson of the legislative bodies must expeditiously take a decision. Here also, the anti-defection law is not implemented in letter and spirit and because of the inaction of the Speaker or Chairman, the legislators continue in the new party and, in a few cases, even become ministers in the government. This kind of travesty of justice should not be tolerated. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Any delays in these cases erode public confidence in the judicial and legislative bodies. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">I would suggest that we should have special judicial tribunals which will decide the cases within a reasonable time of, let us say six months or at the most one year. I would also suggest we revisit the 10th Schedule of our Constitution, containing anti-defection provisions, to ensure a time bound disposal of such cases and make it more effective by plugging loopholes. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">It is time to consider to evolve Standard Operation Procedures that specify the number of adjournments permissible and the outer limit for disposing of cases  based on the nature of cases. Judges and advocates need to imbibe time discipline and adhere to SOPs to ensure speedy justice. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Dear Sisters &amp; brothers</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Government has enhanced the number of judges in the Supreme Court by 10% but I am afraid it may be still inadequate.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Expanding the Supreme Court bench and having separate benches in different regions on trial basis has been suggested by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Law and Justice.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">As the Law Commission has suggested, there is a need for division of the Supreme Court into a Constitution Bench at Delhi and Cassation benches in four regions—Delhi, Chennai/Hyderabad, Kolkata and Mumbai.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">I tend to agree with this recommendation. I think it is high time we had more benches because in a country as vast as India the litigants have to travel long distances and spend a huge amount of money and energy.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">A number of civil and criminal cases have been pending for over 25 years. This makes me think that we need to not only expand the Supreme Court but also divide the work into Constitutional Division and a number of legal divisions or Courts of Appeal. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">As the Law Commission has suggested, I would like the Supreme Court to have two divisions’ one dealing with Constitutional matters and another with appeals. This suggestion merits serious consideration and decision by the Supreme Court as well as the government because it would enable the Supreme Court to devote more time to Constitutional issues and make it more accessible to common people. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">As regards the need for division of the Apex Court in four regions, Article 130 of the constitution states: “The Supreme Court shall sit in Delhi or in such other place or places, as the Chief Justice of India may, with the approval of the President, from time to time, appoint”.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">At the end I would like to quote David Pannick a Member of Parliament in UK and a legal luminary “Judges are mere mortals but they are asked to perform a function that is truly divine.” Yes, ensuring delivery of justice in time is a divine task and the judges and advocates should rise to the task to uphold the divinity associated in delivering justice to the deserving. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Shri P P Rao is one of those rare legal luminaries who spent a lifetime to the delivery of Justice.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">             I am happy to be associated with the release of this Book which holds mirror to the mind and life of PP and his distinguished contributions over four decades to the cause of upholding law and enriching the attendant processes.            </span></span></p>
