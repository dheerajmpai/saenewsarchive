He said that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has always emphasised on the ‘Neighbourhood First” policy. He expressed happiness over the fact that India today has achieved a level in civil services training which is being emulated by other countries. He said that many students are visiting India from neighbouring countries for studies. Dr Singh said that India has focussed on ‘maximum governance and minimum government’. India has done away with interview at lower level posts and attestation of documents, which shows its confidence and trust in its citizens.
