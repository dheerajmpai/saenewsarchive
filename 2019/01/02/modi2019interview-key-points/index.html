<p style="text-align:justify">In a 95-minute long interaction started with the intorregation on the humbling defeat of the BJP in the 5 state elections. Despite the defeats, the Prime Minister maintained that 2018 had been a successful year, elaborating on a number of achievements such as Ayushman Bharat yojana and some quite stellar results, to electrifying all villages in the country, to ISRO&#8217;s undertakings, and others. When pressed on the election results, he provided an analysis accepting the mandate in Chhattisgarh and citing anti-incumbency and a split verdict in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He also attacked on the theorist who claimed that BJP would win only 180 seats in the LS election. He rubbished the claim saying that there were similar analysts in 2014 also but the people would always vote for the right Party. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">When asked about the &#8216;Mahaghatbhandan&#8217; he told that the opposition has no idea what to work. They have been just conspiring to bring down the nation. He also claimed the people would understand the conspiracy and would vote wisely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He was asked about his and Amit Shah&#8217;s stated objective of having a Congress-mukt Bharat, at which he provided a background for the view, putting forth that the culture of the Congress &#8211; casteism, dynastic politics, being undemocratic and nepotism, as per him &#8211; were things that not only the country, but the Congress also needs to be free of. He concluded that the Congress has even failed to provide a strong opposition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">On demonetisation, black money, GST and economic fugitives</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In terms of the biggest issues in the lead-up to the elections, the Prime Minister was asked first about demonetisation,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> for which he provided a background by citing how it was common </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">knowledge that a parallel economy was running on black money. &#8220;Those </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">sacks full of cash have now entered the banking structure&#8221;, he said, </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">also refuting that the note-ban had entailed a &#8216;jhatka&#8217; (shock). His </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">reasoning for this was the myriad black money amnesty schemes that had </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">been announced in the year preceding demonetisation.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Next up was the action on corruption, including on absconders like </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi and Vijay Mallya, as well as on UPA-era scams </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">like 2G and CWG. On the former, i.e. absconders, he said that because of</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> his government the earlier cycle of looters looting endlessly had ended</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> and those who felt they were at risk of being caught had to flee. He </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">said that all possible means were being employed to bring absconders </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">back and assured that they would.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Prime Minister also reiterated, &#8220;We have entered into agreements </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">with various countries. After 2019, we will get real time information </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">from different countries. So Black Money will be brought back.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">On UPA-era corruption, the Prime Minister spoke about how a number of top politicians, including from the &#8216;first family&#8217; (a clear reference to the Gandhis) and a former Finance Minister (a reference to P Chidambaram) were either out on bail or were making rounds of courts. He dismissed those leaders&#8217; prime response to the crackdown on them &#8212; &#8216;political vendetta&#8217; &#8212; expressing that when a court gives a judgment in a matter, it should be accepted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It is a reality that the so called First Family of the nation is out on bail. Their loyalists may try to hide that fact but they won&#8217;t succeed.A former FM of India has to go to the courts and this also people are seeing: PM @narendramodi— PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 1, 2019</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Earlier, there were so many hidden taxes. The tax rates were also high. GST has made things simpler. It has also brought down the taxes on so many commodities: PM @narendramodi— PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 1, 2019</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">From GST, he moved to the middle-class &#8212; a loyal voter base &#8212; for which he said &#8220;we will have to change our thinking.&#8221; He listed various figures highlighting how the middle-class&#8217; aspirations had been addressed, including on low inflation, the Udan Yojana, the Mudra Yojana, and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Inflation is at a low. More educational institutions like IITs and IIMs are being set up.There is a scheme for quality and affordable healthcare. Flying has become affordable and due to that more people are sitting in planes. Who is this benefiting?The middle class: PM— PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 1, 2019</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Social, political and religious issues- Ram Mandir to cow-vigilantism, triple talaq to Sabarimala and farmer issues </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Coming to a more politico-economically controversial topic, he spoke about farmer issues, especially against the backdrop of the Congress touting farm-loan waivers as what appears to be its biggest poll plank. The Prime Minister, however, dubbed the farm-loan waivers a &#8216;lollypop&#8217;, and went into their history, accusing the Congress of not only lying about the efficacy of their farm-loan waivers, but also for not taking the requisite steps when they were in power that would have mitigated the kind of issues farmers face now. He then put forth his government&#8217;s view that while state governments are at liberty to waive farmers&#8217; loans, the central government is committed to addressing their problems</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">When asked about peace negotiations with Pakistan he said &#8220;Everyone is ready to have a dialogue with Pakistan. But can we listen anything amidst bombs?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">On the surgical strikes, there are some political parties who began to speak the same language as Pakistan.These parties were demeaning our armed forces. They politicised such an issue.As the PM, I will always appreciate the armed forces: PM @narendramodi— PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 1, 2019</p>
