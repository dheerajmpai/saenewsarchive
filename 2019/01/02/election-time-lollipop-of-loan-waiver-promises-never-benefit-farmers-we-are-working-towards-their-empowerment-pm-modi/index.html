<p style="text-align:justify">#PMtoANI on loan waivers by Congress state Govts: To say a lie and mislead, that is what I called lollipop. Like saying &#8216;we have waived all farm loans&#8217;. The truth is that nothing like that has happened. Please see their own circulars, they should not mislead. pic.twitter.com/BOISilifuf— ANI (@ANI) January 1, 2019</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">ANI editor asked the PM that Rahul Gandhi and his party has often </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">alleged that the NDA government has allowed economic offenders to flee </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">the country while farmers in the country are suffering, PM stated that </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Congress often resorts to slandering while ignoring its own failure to </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">provide relief to farmers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">PM Modi asserted that as he has stated before, Congress’ promise of farm loan waivers is just a lollipop to cheat people. He explained that time and again, Congress has used loan waivers as an election time trick while actually doing nothing for farmers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Over the allegations by the opposition that billionaire economic </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">offenders like Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi had fled while farmers in the </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">country are suffering, the PM stated that waiving off farmers’ loan is </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">never the solution, had it been the solution, why are there still </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">farmers in distress while multiple governments have promised loan </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">waivers over the years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">PM Modi asserted that the solution to tackle agrarian distress is to </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">empower the farmers. Highlighting his slogan of ‘Beej se le kar bazar </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">tak’ PM stated that his government is attempting to offer farmers </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">long-term solutions via Irrigation projects, value addition, </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">minimalising wastage, logistical solutions to stop distribution issues </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">and providing facilities like storage, marketing and technological </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">assistance. He also added that his government has spent thousands of </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">crores in irrigation projects that will directly benefit countless </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">farmers, but irrigation projects are not an election gimmick, so media </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">never focuses on it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">PM stated that his government is trying to create an environment in </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">the country that farmers do not even need to take loans. He also </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">highlighted the fact that the Swaminathan report had come in 2007, yet, </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">the UPA government never implemented it. He added that had the UPA </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">government had implemented the recommendations of the report instead of </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">the false promise of waiving off the farm loans to win the 2009 </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">elections, the agrarian scenario in the country now would have been </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">drastically different.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He then stated that by raising the MSP of 22 chief crops, his </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">government has ensured that farmers earn more. PM Modi also asserted </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">that instead of falling for the bait of Congress over the loan waiver </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">gimmick, media in the country should behave more responsibly and attempt</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> to find out how many farmers have actually benefitted from the loan </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">waiver schemes that have been announced before every election.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">PM Modi also added that state governments are free to implement farm </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">loan waivers and his government has never objected to it. He insisted </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">that farmers of the country will actually benefit when governments start</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> offering holistic, practical solutions and not election time </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">‘lollipops’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">PM Modi had expressed his criticism over the election time gimmick of</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> farm loan waivers at a rally in Ghazipur, Uttar Pradesh recently. The </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">PM had stated that loan waivers are not a solution to agrarian issues </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">and they do not solve the problems the farmers are facing,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Hinting at a comprehensive plan by the central government, the PM had</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> stated that the Congress had cheated the farmers in several states by </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">promising the ‘lollipop’ of big promises and then have failed the farmers in every state.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In Karnataka, despite announcements by the government that they have </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">allocated funds of Rs 44,000 crores, only 800 farmers have reportedly </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">benefitted from the loan waiver scheme. In recent weeks, many farmers </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">have received recovery notices from banks, facing arrest and many have also committed suicide.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">in Madhya Pradesh too, the Congress had created hype over signing </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">loan waivers within a day of Kamal Nath assuming office but the waiver </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">scheme came with a number of terms and conditions which made very few farmers eligible for the waiver scheme.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">PM Modi has always maintained that his government is committed to double the farmers’ income by 2022. The NDA government has taken a number of steps including raising the MSP, digitalising benefit transfer schemes, minimising wastage and direct marketing to consumers through eNAM to achieve this goal. The year 2017-18 saw India’s highest production of foodgrains so far.</p>
