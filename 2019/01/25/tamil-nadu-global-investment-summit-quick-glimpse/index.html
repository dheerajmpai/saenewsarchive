<p style="text-align:justify"> is continuously focussing on equitable, inclusive growth and on </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">bridging income inequalities. A number of schemes like Jan Dhan Yojana, </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Saubhagya and Ujjwala stand testament to the core values of </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">inclusiveness that India adheres to’, the Vice President of India, Shri </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">M. Venkaiah Naidu has said, in Chennai today. He was addressing the </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">gathering at the valedictory function of Tamil Nadu Global Investors </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Meet (GIM)-2019. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He urged investors to seize the moment and invest in India.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> Vice President quoted the Sustainable Development Goals 2030 which </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">emphasized upon the need for nations to focus more on equitable economic</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> growth and to reduce inequalities and said that the Government of India</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> has embarked on a similar path in the last 4 years by having “Sab ka </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Saath, Sab ka Vikas” (Assistance to everyone and development of each </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">individual) as the overarching goal. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Naidu applauded the dynamic, visionary leadership in India at the national and state levels that is engaged in reforming governance, reaching higher performance benchmarks &#038; transforming the lives of people. Expressing his joy at the captivating growth story that India has been writing, the Vice President opined that India of today is a land of infinite possibilities and tremendous opportunities. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> Naidu highlighted a number of positive trends the Indian economy has </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">been exhibiting is recent times such as the consistent GDP growth rate </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">and the highest ever growth in FDI inflow. ‘India accounts for about 15%</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> of global growth and it has been estimated that the Indian economy </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">would grow to $10 trillion by 2030’, he said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> Vice President said that measures like demonetization, GST, Insolvency </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">and Bankruptcy Code, repeal of outdated laws, giving thrust to road and </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">air connectivity, increased focus on infrastructure, housing and </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">agricultural sectors have enabled the economy to gather momentum. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Citing</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> the appreciation showered on India by the World Bank and the IMF for </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">resilient and stable growth and their terming of India as the </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">fastest-growing emerging economy in the world, the Vice President said </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">that these recognitions stood testimony to the efficacy of Government </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Policies. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Pointing</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> out that 2018 was replete with external vulnerabilities, the Vice </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">President lauded Indian economy’s ability to withstand such stresses. He</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> credited the robust Institutions of Indian economy, whose roots run </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">deep and wide, for India’s steady momentum. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Underscoring India’s steady ascent in the Ease of Doing Business Index to reach the 77th</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> position, Shri Naidu said that doing business in India has now become </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">much cheaper and faster through GST and other tax reforms as well as </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">through digital processes and single point interfaces and single window </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">clearance systems. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> Vice President said that it was a matter of great satisfaction that </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">many of the global corporate giants, are now actively looking for </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">investment opportunities in India with renewed optimism and enthusiasm, </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">encouraged by India’s vast market of more than a billion consumers, </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">increasing purchasing power, rapidly unfolding technology scenario and </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">cheaper labor market. ‘Backed by strong democracy and partnerships, </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India is all set to be one of the top three economic powers of the world</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> in the next 10 to 15 years’, he said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Speaking</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> about the rich cultural heritage of Tamil Nadu which is home to one of </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">the oldest civilizations of the world, the Vice president applauded the </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Tamil people’s industriousness, entrepreneurship, work culture and </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">creativity. He congratulated its people and the government for their </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">dedication and hard work which made the state one of the best-performing</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> states of India and one of the most sought-after investment </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">destinations. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Applauding</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> the huge amount of investments that the summit garnered, the Vice </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">President said that this investment should not be concentrated in big </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">cities but must reach rural areas and villages so that the fruits of </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">development reaches the last person. Shri Naidu assured the investors </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">that their investments would yield rich dividends in India.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Stating</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> that India’s federal structure allows adequate space for states to </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">decide their own priorities and forge their own developmental </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">strategies, the Vice President said that  the states are now more </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">empowered than ever before as a result of greater devolution of funds </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">and increased autonomy, ‘I am happy to see that a healthy competition is</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> unfolding among states to attract investment and develop </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">entrepreneurship. This is truly competitive and cooperative federalism </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">at its best’, he added.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> welcomed the delegates of GIM-2019 to India, and said that India </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">believes that cooperation and partnership are the bedrock of shared </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">prosperity. ‘India has a strong desire to deepen economic ties with </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">other countries and wants a just and receptive world economic order’ he </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">said. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Naming</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> some of the impediments to progress such as terrorism and corruption as</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> well as unethical business practices, he said that India has been </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">arguing for a consensus and concerted action at global level on these </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">negative forces that negate human progress and prosperity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Shri Edappadi K. Palaniswami , the Deputy</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Shri O. Panneerselvam, the Minister of </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">State for Finance and Shipping, Shri P. Radhakrishnan, the Minister for </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Industries, Tamil Nadu, Shri. M.C. Sampath and others were present on </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">the occasion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Following is the text of Vice President&#8217;s address:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">&#8220;I</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> am happy to participate in this valedictory function of Tamil Nadu </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Global Investors Meet (GIM)-2019. I extend my greetings and good wishes </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">to all the delegates. I congratulate the Chief Minister, Deputy Chief </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Minister and the Government of Tamil Nadu for organising this Investor </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Meet. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Events</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> like this provide an ideal platform to showcase the strengths of a </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">state and the myriad opportunities that it offers to investors. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The growth trajectory of Indian economy is now being reshaped by its youth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">About</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> 850 million, constituting about 65% of India’s population, is in the </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">age group of 18 to 35. India is likely to have the world’s largest </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">workforce by 2027, with a billion people aged between 15 and 64.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">We</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> have a dynamic, visionary leadership at the national and state levels </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">that is engaged in reforming governance, reaching higher performance </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">benchmarks and transforming the lives of people. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> is at the cusp of a major transformation and is poised to maximize the </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">tremendous demographic dividend in the next few years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">For</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> the first time ever, India has registered the fastest growth in FDI in </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">over two decades. The FDI inflows into India were to the tune of $38 </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">billion in 2018, overtaking China and evolving as the favorite </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">destination in emerging markets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India also accounts for about 15% of global growth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> has always been quite receptive to new ideas, technologies and growth </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">opportunities. We believe that we all belong to one big family and we </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">must grow together by capitalizing on the comparative strengths of each </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">country.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">With</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> greater infusion of capital and knowledge, the aspirational India has </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">hitched its wagon to accelerated, inclusive, environmentally sustainable</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> development.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> am hopeful that confluences of investors and entrepreneurs like the GIM</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> 2019 will help open up new opportunities for investment and growth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dear sisters and brothers,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> is indeed heartening to note than India has been writing a captivating </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">growth story. India of today is a land of infinite possibilities and </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">tremendous opportunities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> you all are aware, the liberalization of the Indian economy began in </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">the early nineties under the regime of the then Prime Minister, Shri P V</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> Narasimha Rao. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> liberalization process further picked up momentum under the leadership </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">of Shri Vajpayee the then Prime Minister. Shri Vajpayee ushered in a new</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> connectivity revolution in different sectors from telecom to rural </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">roads, giving the much needed impetus to the Indian economy. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Now,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi through various measures and reforms</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> has ensured that the fundamentals of the Indian economy remain strong </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">as it continues on the growth trajectory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The reforms taken up by the Government in the past few years have made India the top destination for investments in the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> would be relevant here to recall that former US President, Barack Obama</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> had described Shri Narendra Modi as ‘Reformer-in-Chief’ in a profile he</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> had written on the Prime Minister for the Time Magazine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The entire world is looking towards India and there has been renewed focus on the country in the past few years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India has achieved a GDP growth of 7.6 per cent in the first half of 2018-19. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The size of the Indian economy is expected to touch $10 trillion by 2030.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dr</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> Raghuram Rajan, the former Governor of the Reserve Bank, has recently </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">said, “India will become bigger than China eventually as the latter </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">would slow down, whereas the former would continue to grow. So, India </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">will be in a better position to create the infrastructure in the region </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">which China is promising today”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Measures</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> like demonetization, GST, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, repeal of </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">outdated laws, giving thrust to road and air connectivity, increased </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">focus on infrastructure, housing and agricultural sectors have enabled </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">the economy to gather momentum. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Today, India is home to second largest start-up ecosystem in the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> is expected to emerge as the third largest consumer market, just behind</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> the US and China, the World Economic Forum said, in a report titled </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">&#8216;Future of Consumption in Fast-Growth Consumer Market – India&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> success of the government policies is further reaffirmed when </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">international organisations of great repute such as the World Bank and </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">the IMF applaud India’s resilient and stable growth and term India as </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">the fastest-growing emerging economy in the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Gita</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> Gopinath, Chief Economist at International Monetary Fund (IMF), in an </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">interview to Economic times, has said, “India remains one of the fastest</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> growing large economies of the world and it is one of the few countries</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> for which our estimates actually point to increase in growth rate for </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">2019.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> World Bank in its latest forecast has said that India will continue to </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">be the fastest growing major economy in the world. It said the GDP is </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">expected to grow at 7.3 per cent this fiscal year and at 7.5 per cent in</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> the following two years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“India</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> will continue to remain the world&#8217;s fastest-growing large economy in </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">2019 as well as in 2020, much ahead of China”,according to very recent </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">World Economic Situation and Prospects (WESP) 2019 report of UN. It also</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> said the GDP is expected to accelerate to 7.6 per cent in 2019-20. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">2018</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> was replete with external vulnerabilities. Oil prices were on the rise,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> economies were veering towards protectionism and trade wars were </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">brewing between major global trading partners. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Yet, India managed to maintain its steady course. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">One of the reasons for this stability was the robustness of India’s Institutions. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Being</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> a vibrant, functioning democracy for the last 70 years, India has the </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">advantage of an institutional structure whose roots run deep and wide.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Doing</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> business in India has now become much cheaper and faster through GST </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">and other tax reforms as well as through digital processes and single </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">point interfaces and single window clearance systems. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Moody’s,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> the renowned sovereign rating agency lauded reforms such as Goods and </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Services Tax (GST) and demonetisation for their potential to reduce </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">informality in the economy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> leveraging of Information Technology through mission mode projects like</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> Digital India has simplified many complicated and multi layered </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">procedures.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As a result, India has recorded a jump of 23 positions and is placed now at 77thrank among 190 countries assessed by the World Bank for Ease of Doing Business.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India aims to be among the top 50 nations in the coming year.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> is among top three countries where trust in government remains high. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Edelman Trust Barometer Global Report for 2019, released at Davos, </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">has said that trust in institutions in India rose by four points to 72. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dear delegates,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> is matter of great satisfaction that many of the global corporate </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">giants, some of whom are present here today, are now actively looking </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">for investment opportunities in India with renewed optimism and </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">enthusiasm, encouraged by India’s vast market of more than a billion </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">consumers, increasing purchasing power, rapidly unfolding technology </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">scenario and cheaper labor market.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">With</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> great thrust on building industrial corridors smart cities and housing </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">for all, the government aims to assure holistic development of the </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">nation. The corridors would promote integration, development and create </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">an enabling atmosphere for industrial development, thus taking full </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">advantage of the possibilities of Industrial Revolution 4.0.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Backed</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> by strong democracy and partnerships, India is all set to be one of the</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> top three economic powers of the world in the next 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dear sisters and brothers,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">However, a number of challenges still persist.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India’s banking sector is effectively grappling with accumulating non-performing assets and bad loans.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">A major threat to world economy is the rising inequality. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> World Economic Forum 2019 has noted that the situation of inequality is</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> getting so bad that it&#8217;s threatening the very foundation of economic </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">growth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> worries policymakers everywhere for good reason. Research at the IMF </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">and elsewhere makes it clear that persistent lack of inclusion—defined </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">as broadly shared benefits and opportunities for economic growth—can </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">fray social cohesion and undermine the sustainability of growth itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> Sustainable Development Goals 2030 also emphasize the need for nations </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">to focus more on equitable economic growth and to reduce inequalities </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">and reach out to those populations who have been left out of the </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">development process.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> Government of India has embarked on a similar path in the last 4 years </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">by having “Sab ka Saath, Sab ka Vikas” (Assistance to everyone and </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">development of each individual) as the overarching goal. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Adopting</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> the Antyodaya approach, the development strategy has been refashioned </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">to include the excluded. Social and financial inclusion has been the </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">main thrust of all the governmental programmes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Along</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> with vertical growth, India is continuously focussing on horizontal </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">growth and bridging of income disparities and other inequalities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> am happy to note that a number of schemes like Jan Dhan Yojana, </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Saubhagya and Ujjwala stand testament to the core values of </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">inclusiveness that India adheres to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Let us all work towards ensuring an equitable economic growth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Our</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> ultimate goal should be to achieve the long-lasting development for an </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">inclusive and equitable society whereby the benefits of prosperous </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">growth reaches the last man in the queue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Sisters and brothers,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> efficient functioning of any economy depends greatly upon efficient </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">dispute settlements and time-bound contract enforcements. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I am glad that alternate dispute resolution mechanisms and tribunals are being strengthened.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dear sisters and brothers,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Tamil Nadu is supremely rich in cultural heritage. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">One</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> of the oldest civilization of the world, Tamil Nadu has been home to </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">great kings, talented writers, gifted poets and prolific builders. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Much has been said and written about the Tamil people’s industriousness, entrepreneurship and creativity. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It is a place that is close to my heart as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> am very happy to learn that it is one of the best-performing states of </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India and has emerged as one of the most sought-after investment </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">destinations. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I am glad to know that GIM-2019 has attracted substantial investments in Manufacturing, Infrastructure and Services. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It is worth noting that NITI Ayog has ranked Tamil Nadu as one of the front-runners in India on many socio-economic parameters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Tamil</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> Nadu has emerged as a leader in the manufacture of automobiles and </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">components, electronic hardware, textiles, leather products and </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">renewable energy apart from software development and IT enabled </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">services. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It has also become the third largest exporting State in India. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I extend hearty congratulations to the people and the government of Tamil Nadu for their dedication and hard work. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> being a federal polity, the country’s governance structure allows </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">adequate space for states to decide their own priorities and forge their</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> own developmental strategies. With greater devolution of funds and </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">increased autonomy, the states are now more empowered than ever before. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> am happy to see that a healthy competition is unfolding among states to</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> attract investment and develop entrepreneurship. This is truly </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">competitive and cooperative federalism at its best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dear delegates,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">You have travelled a long way to come here today. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India’s tradition is to welcome its guests with open hearts; ‘Athithi devobhava ’, is</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> our motto. I welcome you to this ancient land and youthful country, to </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">the land of fascinating diversity and timeless values of peace, </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">coexistence and inclusive growth, a land of expanding opportunities, a </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">land that believes that cooperation and partnership are the bedrock of </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">shared prosperity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> has a strong desire to deepen economic ties with other countries and </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">wants a just and receptive world economic order. We recognize painfully </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">some of the impediments to progress such as terrorism and corruption as </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">well as unethical business practices. We have been arguing for a </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">consensus and concerted action at global level on these negative forces </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">that negate human progress and prosperity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Together, we can create a more peaceful world that is the foundation for a prosperous world. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> the Indian context, we have to constantly remind ourselves that most of</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> the people, especially in the rural areas, are depending on </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">agriculture. This sector, along with industry and small and medium </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">enterprises, needs to be made more profitable and sustainable. We must </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">bridge the rural – urban divide. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> would urge each one of you to focus on channelling greater investments </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">and launch innovative projects and practices that can address the </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">livelihood concerns of our large farming community.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> hope you will strive to build, during this event as well as later, </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">meaningful and mutually beneficial, long lasting relationships founded </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">on trust and friendship. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As our Prime Minister has often said, ‘India is now ready for business as never before.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> welcome each and every one of you to seize the moment and invest in </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India. I am sure it will be truly rewarding, for you as well as for us. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“Saha Veeryam Karavaavahai ” (Let us grow together) as the ancient Indian sages had said and transform the lives of people for the better.</p>
