The nation was in the deep sleep. But for Kashmiri Pandits and Sikhs the worst nightmare had come true. The loudspeakers in the valley announced &#8216;Convert to Islam, Leave or die&#8217;. Lakhs of woman were raped, men slayed and children abducted and sold as slaves. Lakhs had to moved away from their house. And the rest converted to &#8216;The religion of peace&#8217;, Islam.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Kashmiri exodus was the worst ever ethnic cleansing that took place in Independent India. Thousands of Kashmiri non-Muslims were killed. Over 3,50,000 Kashmiri Pandits fled the valley. Their properties being looted burnt and captured. Motivated by the Afghan Jihad against the Soviet Union The JKLF and the pro-Pakistan Islamist groups including Jamaat-e-Islami Kashmir were mobilizing Anti-Indian sentiments in the valley. Both the terror groups were alleged to be heavily funded by ISI.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Neither the state nor the central government supported the Kashmiri Pandits. In fact the then govt headed by Farooq Abdullah did exactly the opposite. The government commanded the police to not arrest any terrorist belonging to JKLF and the pro-Pakistan Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami Kashmir. On 4 January 1990, a local Urdu newspaper, Aftab, published a press release issued by Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, asking all Pandits to leave the Valley immediately. No action was taken by the state or the center against the terrorist organization. The series of activities just boosted the morale of the terrorists.</p>

Thousands of Jehadist came out with slogans “Kashir banawon Pakistan, Bataw varaie, Batneiw saan” (We will turn Kashmir into Pakistan alongwith Kashmiri Pandit women, but without their men folk) threatening every single non-Muslim in the valley. The autrocity did not stop there. Over 208 Temples were plundered. The paradise of earth had now turned into an ocean of blood.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">No media covered the news, no politician led their support. The &#8216;Pidi&#8217; media, even today, doesn&#8217;t give a damn about the unfortunate incident. Infact they did the exact opposite. Burkha Dutt, a hindu-phobic hate news peddler, went ahead and justified the genocide. &#8216;Due to the economic reason the uprising was imminent&#8217;.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Long after the refugees settled in parts of Jammu and Delhi the political parties took the incident to the political advantage. The UPA-1 govt allocated Rs 1000 crore for the resettlement of Kashmiri Pandit. Unfortunately, leaders from the same party went against the policy in Kashmir . The Congress opposed the separate township for Kashmiri resettlers. The BJP and RSS guaranteed the resettlement of Kashmiri Pandits if comes to power. But no action had been taken by the party despite gaining power both at centre as well as in the state. As of 2016, only 1,800 out of 3,50,000 Kashmiri Pandits and their desedents have returned to the Valley. While the rest still wait for the justice.</p>
