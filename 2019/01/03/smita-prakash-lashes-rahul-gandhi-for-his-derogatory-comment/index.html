<p style="text-align:justify">Dear Mr Rahul Gandhi, cheap shot at your press conference to attack me. I was asking questions not answering. You want to attack Mr Modi, go ahead but downright absurd to ridicule me. Not expected of a president of the oldest political party in the country.— Smita Prakash (@smitaprakash) January 2, 2019</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">By using terms like &#8220;pliable&#8221;, &#8220;presstitute&#8221;,&#8221;paid media&#8221;,our political establishment, aided by their troll armies, show their scant respect for the fourth estate. Shameful comment by the Congress President. https://t.co/XJ3gGzOAXK— Suhasini Haidar (@suhasinih) January 3, 2019</p>
