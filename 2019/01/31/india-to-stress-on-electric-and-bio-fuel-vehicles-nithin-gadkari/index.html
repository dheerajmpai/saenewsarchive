<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Gadkari said, the future belongs to electric and bio- fuel based transport vehicles. These are cost effective, pollution free and cut import bill on petroleum products. He said, using Ethanol and Methanol is also a good option. He cited the example of Nagpur, where bio-CNG is being produced from fruit, mutton waste etc. For intercity transport, he advocated adopting broad-gauge metro, for which rolling stock is readily available. He said, studies suggest that against the construction cost of Rs 350 crore per kilometre for traditional metro, it comes to only Rs 3 crore for broad-gauge metro. The Minister informed that 111 waterways are being prepared in different cities and rivers with World Bank assistance. He requested World Bank representative present on the occasion to prepare total transport vision for India.</p>
