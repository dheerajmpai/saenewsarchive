<p style="text-align:justify">Lo and behold. Its proven time and again, dynasty politics thy name is congress. The congress party since its infamous takeover by Indira Gandhi is known for its brazen way of inducting family into the party or is it the other way around. The Gandhi Nehru family relegated the position of the great Indian national congress to a “family owned and operated organisation”. Sounding death knell to the inner party democracy of the old congress to such a state that its not flattery to state that there is only one family ruling India.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The timing can never be more worse, when congress is facing a strong foe and has to fight tooth and nail just maintain its presence in Uttar Pradesh. Apart from the Bhartiya janatha party the congress is going to face pressure from the other end in form of SP-BSP coalition which disagree to side with the congress. the Bhartiya janatha party has a powerful presence in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh, the constituencies of Narendra Modi(Varanasi), and yogi Adityanaths Gorakhpur are in western part of India’s largest state.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The strong presence of Hindutva forces and the Hindu Yuva Vahini makes it difficult for the congress to get a foothold in the region.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Mrs Vadra also lack seniority, respect and experience , perhaps her only political capital is her surname(or vadra). This depicts the sorry state of affairs in the congress party and can be used as a political ammunition by the Bhartiya janatha party and voters can easily be turned off by this move.</p>
