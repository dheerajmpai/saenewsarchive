<p style="text-align:justify">Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a historic decision to include economically backward classes under reservation.The NDA govt resolved to increase the upper limit of reservation from 50% to 60%.While the first 50% is already reserved for caste based reservation. The remaining 10% would be dedicated for the Economically weaker sections.Every individual with an income of less than 8 Lakhs would get the benefits in education and employment under the new quota policy.There will be no discrimination on the basis of caste/religion . The benefits would apply across all the castes.BJP govt has always been against Caste-based reservation. This move would reinforce their stance on the Vote bank politics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Prime Minister Modi has sent shock waves from Kashmir to KanyaKumari and Imphal to Ahmedabad in just one stroke. The government has now decided to give 10% Quota for the economically weaker section.(EWS)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This would include all individuals whose annual income is less than 8 Lakhs. People with EWS would get the Quota in the field of education and employment.</p>
