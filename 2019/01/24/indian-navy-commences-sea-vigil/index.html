It was the largest such exercise the country had ever witnessed in recent times and saw participation by more than a hundred ships, aircraft and patrol boats manned and operated by various security agencies. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Exercise had started on 22nd January and included two distinct stages. In the first phase, all stakeholders assessed the robustness of their own businesses. The safety agencies could thwart attempts by the opposing power to infiltrate on the coast using commandeered fishing boats. Response of agencies to additional safety contingencies like hijacking of a ship and assault on offshore installations off Kochi Harbour was also evaluated. All of infiltration attempts will be assessed promptly to spot gaps in the multi-tier security layers in sea, near the land and in the hinterland in close coordination with concerned stakeholders. </p>
