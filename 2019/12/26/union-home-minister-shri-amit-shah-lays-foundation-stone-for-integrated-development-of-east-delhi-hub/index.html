<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Shah said that the Union Government&#8217;s decision to regularize 1731 unauthorized colonies and conferring ownership rights at a nominal cost has ensured a dignified life for 40 lakh poor people living in these colonies. He informed that 13 laws that were a hindrance to this decision were bypassed with a single cabinet decision by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Shah said that the Union Government had ensured justice for the victims of anti Sikh riots by forming an SIT and punishing the culprits. He also said that the opening up of Kartarpur corridor was a major step by the Union Government for Sikh Pilgrims on the 550th anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev ji.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Shah also congratulated Shri Puri for successfully executing Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi&#8217;s vision for Delhi&#8217;s development. Shri Shah added that a new work culture of speed and efficiency is now the norm in the Modi Government. He also said that in a departure from earlier practice, this Government is more efficient and tends to complete projects within time limited, and thus the Government that lays down the foundation stone of a project is the same one that inaugurates it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Shah alleged that 80 percent of welfare schemes announced by Delhi Government remain unfulfilled and major among them are like providing jobs to 8 lakh youths and clean drinking water to every household. He also mentioned that Delhi has the worst quality of drinking water in the country.
