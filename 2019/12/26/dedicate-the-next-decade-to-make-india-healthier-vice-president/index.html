<p style="text-align:justify">“Namaskar,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I am delighted to be present here in the beautiful city of Rajahmundry (Raja Mahendravaram) located on the banks of Godavari River today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I am happy to inaugurate Delta Hospital headed by a highly talented and experienced team of doctors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I am happy to know that the hospital is equipped to provide advanced treatment for cancer, cardiac and other ailments.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dear sisters and brothers</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Our country has made significant progress in improving its health outcomes over the years. We have eliminated polio, guinea worm disease, yaws, and maternal and neonatal tetanus.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It is to the credit of successive governments at the Centre and in various States that we could achieve it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Our Total Fertility Rate (TFR) has reduced sharply from 3.4 in 1992-93 to 2.2 in 2015-16. Contrary to expectations, we were able to achieve the Millennium Development Goals in respect of the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR level of 130 against a target of 139) and almost succeeded in meeting the Under-5 child mortality target (U5 MR level of 43 against a target of 42).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Government of India has initiated several reforms to improve citizens&#8217; access to good quality, affordable healthcare with an aim to achieve Universal Health Coverage by 2030.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India’s vision for a healthy India requires a transformation of the delivery of health services in both urban and rural areas, by involving both the public and the private sectors. Apart from improving the infrastructure in the public health institutions at the district level and in villages, we need to overcome the shortage of doctors and trained paramedical personnel, both in urban and rural areas. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In the context of the rising Non-Communicable Diseases, owing to the change in lifestyle and dietary habits, there is an urgent need to focus on the health and wellbeing of all the people. WHO report says that around 61 percent of deaths in India are attributed to non-communicable diseases, including heart disorders, cancer, and diabetes. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">We need to dedicate the next decade&#8211; from 2020 – 2030 to make India healthier by focusing on promoting a healthy lifestyle, improving healthcare facilities, making healthcare affordable and accessible to all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The private sector must supplement the efforts of the government in improving the healthcare infrastructure, particularly in the rural areas and in providing affordable treatment to the common man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As you all aware, the out-of-pocket expenses constitute a major chunk of the spending by patients. As a result, many poor and needy families end up in debts. This is an area of concern and needs to be addressed by all stakeholders in the health sector. I am happy that the Government of India has launched Ayushman Bharat to provide affordable health insurance to all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In view of the growing incidence of non-communicable, the private must play a prominent role in setting up of NCD clinics in both urban and rural areas</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">All our efforts must be aimed at enhancing both the efficiency and quality of medical services. We need to innovate, learn from the best practices world over to improve healthcare without financially burdening people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dear sisters &#038; brothers,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Achieving universal healthcare has many challenges including the urban-rural divide in quality healthcare facilities. The disparity in providing healthcare facilities, especially to those living in rural areas remains a major concern for all of us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I urge the private sector to expand its footprint to the villages and remote rural areas and reach out to people with affordable healthcare. It is important for the private sector to complement the efforts of the government in reaching modern healthcare facilities people living in rural areas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">There is a need to launch a national movement against the growing incidence of non-communicable diseases and hospitals such as yours and the Indian Medical Association should take lead in creating awareness among the people, especially the youth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Children and youth must be made aware of the hazards caused by unhealthy dietary habits and sedentary lifestyles. Students in schools must be encouraged to take part in at least one physical activity or yoga every day to stay fit and healthy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I am sure the management of Delta Hospitals, Doctors and the professionals associated with the hospital will keep service as their motto and perform to the best of their abilities to deliver good healthcare to people of this region.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Jai Hind!”</p>
