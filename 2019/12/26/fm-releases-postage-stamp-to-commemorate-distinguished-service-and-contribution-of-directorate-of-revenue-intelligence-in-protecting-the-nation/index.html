<p style="text-align:justify">About Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) was constituted on 4th December, 1957 to function as an apex intelligence agency of the Central Board of Indirect Taxes &#038; Customs to counter the menace of smuggling. Through the years, DRI has established itself as the premier intelligence agency commanding the trust of international and national agencies with its intelligence inputs on myriad subjects inter alia ranging from FICN, narcotics, gold, arms &#038; ammunitions, wildlife, cultural heritage and commercial fraud. Over the years, the organisation has sought to reorient itself to new and emerging challenges, such as those relating to black money, money-laundering and narco-terrorism.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The DRI has also been designated as the lead agency for S-CORD, the national Anti-smuggling co-ordination centre. Being the apex anti-smuggling enforcement organisation and given its track record in collaborative endeavours, DRI is expected to carry along the Border agencies towards the common objective of thwarting smuggling activities that pose a grave threat to national security and economic well-being of the country.</p>
