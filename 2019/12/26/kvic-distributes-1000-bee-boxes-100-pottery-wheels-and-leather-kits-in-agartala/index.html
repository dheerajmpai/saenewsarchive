The objective of this event is not only to empower the rural artisans and help them gain confidence in bee keeping, pottery and leather artistry, but also improve their quality of life. Tripura has a lot of potential of Bee Keeping and Pottery because of large scale cultivation of rubber plants and use of traditional terracotta products in their households.”</p>
