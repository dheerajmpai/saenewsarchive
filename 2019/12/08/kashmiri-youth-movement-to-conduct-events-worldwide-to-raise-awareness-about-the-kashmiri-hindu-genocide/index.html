<p>The Kashmiri Hindu exodus is one of the bloodiest exodus the nation ever faced. The Kashmiri Hindu community faced <a href="http://www.koausa.org/exodus/chapter1.html">seven waves of exodus</a> since the first one that took place in 1300 to the seventh one in 1990s. More than a million were displaced from their homeland and are living as refugees in multiple parts of the world. Yet it is often neglected by the media and also by the Indian government. Till date, textbooks nor the mainstream media mention the atrocities faced by the Kashmiri Pandits.</p>
