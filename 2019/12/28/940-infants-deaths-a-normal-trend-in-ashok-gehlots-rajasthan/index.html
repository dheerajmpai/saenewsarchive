<p>A whopping 940 infants died in Kota&#8217;s J K Lon hospital in 2019. Out of which 77 deaths occured in the month od December itself and 10 deaths in just past 48 hours. The hospital management has skimmed off from taking any responsibilities. According to the report by I<a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/spate-of-infants-death-rocks-kota-1632086-2019-12-28">ndia Today</a>, the management said this is a <strong>&#8220;normal trend&#8221;</strong> and not something unusual. </p>



<p>Rajasthan&#8217;s chief minister Ashok Gehlot has added fuel to the fire by <a href="https://www.newsnation.in/cities/jaipur/nothing-new-rajasthan-cm-ashok-gehlot-says-after-10-newborns-died-in-48-hours-at-kota-hospital-249031.html">stating </a>&#8211; &#8220;Even a single child&#8217;s death is unfortunate.  There are daily few deaths in every hospital in state and country,<strong> there is nothing new.</strong> Action is being taken in the matter&#8221;</p>



<p>The government has allegedly sent a team to Kota to look into the deaths at JK Lon Hospital. The chief minister  has given instructions to Health Secretary Vaibhav Galeria to visit Kota and submit a detailed report on an urgent basis.</p>
