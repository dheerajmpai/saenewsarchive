<p style="text-align:justify">Air Traffic Flow Management Control and Command Center (ATFM-CCC) </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">New Air Traffic Flow Management Control and Command Center (ATFM-CCC) with state of art displays has been operationalized at Vasant Kunj, New Delhi in June, 2019.ATFM Implementation &#8211; Nationwide Central Air Traffic Flow Management [ATFM] system operational since 2017. The Central Command Center (CCC) has become operational from Vasant Kunj premises from 22nd June 2019. The CCC is supported by Flow Management Positions (FMPs) at all major airports (36 in number) which include 8 defence airports. The ATFM system monitors the air traffic flow at all major airports and across all airspace sectors. Whenever any air traffic overload conditions are predicted at any airports / airspace sectors, the ATFM managers, proactively implement ATFM regulations (by delaying the aircraft on ground at departure airports) so that the traffic overloads are “managed”. Thus, ATFM helps in maintaining safety while ensuring optimal use of airports and airspace. India also has hosted the ICAO APAC ATFM Steering group meeting in Delhi in May 2018 wherein 13 APAC countries participated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">CNS/ATM  modernization roadmap for India </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In May 2019, Boeing and the Airports Authority of India (AAI) have signed a technical assistance agreement for developing a comprehensive 10- year Communication, Navigation and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) modernization roadmap for India.  The objective of the agreement is to develop a roadmap for AAI to use as guidance in the modernization of the Indian National Airspace System (NAS) based on global and local best practices to optimally utilize airspace capacity, enhance communications and invest in navigation, surveillance and air traffic management. This 18- month project will be undertaken with a grant from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).  AAI has formed a Technical Working Group (TWG) comprising of nominated members from Airlines, Airport Operators, DGCA, IAF, IMD and AAI officers to jointly work with Boeing experts during the project.
