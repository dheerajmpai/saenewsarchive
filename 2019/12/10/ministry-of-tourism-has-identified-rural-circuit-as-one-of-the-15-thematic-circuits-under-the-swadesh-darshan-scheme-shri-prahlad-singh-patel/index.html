<p style="text-align:justify">The Ministry also promotes the tourism destinations and products including ‘Rural Tourism’ through its websites, and publicity and promotional material produced by it from time to time.  The Ministry does not maintain data with regard to employment generated by implementation of its various schemes.  However, as per the 3rd Tourism Satellite Account of India (TSA) – 2015-16 and its subsequent estimates, the contribution of tourism employment to total  employment of the country during 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19 was 12.20%, 12.13%, 12.75% respectively.</p>
