The ministry has also recognized 4 Water Aerodromes locations in Andaman &#038; Nicobar Island and 2 in Lakshadweep Island that is up for bidding. The efforts are in the direction to provide aerial connectivity to the region. The move will not only boost tourism but will also transform the economic situation of the region. Under the UDAN 4.0 scheme, MoCA is also providing additional Viability Gap Funding (VGF) of around 25% to the airlines.</p>

The market would be incentivized to develop short-haul routes only, providing connectivity to nearby airports.</p>
