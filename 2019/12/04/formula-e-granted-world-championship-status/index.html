<p>The Federation Internationale de lâ€™Automobile (FIA) has granted World Championship status to the electric racing league starting with the 2020-2021 season, making it the only FIA single-seat competition.</p>



<p>The championship will be known as ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, and the driver who wins will be deemed a world champion. Although there is no mention of the championship getting any practical benefits from the title.</p>



<p>The steady build of audience and the high profile companies like Mercedes-Benz and Porsche are factors that may have influenced the decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Formula E would be an eco-friendly league and whether it will eclipse F1 in popularity will be known in the new future.</p>
