<p>Bharti Airtel on Sunday hiked tariff rate in the range of 50 paise per day to Rs. 2.85 per day, effective from December 3. The company announced new plans, which will affect the Airtel pre-paid customers who avail the plans provided by the company under its “unlimited” category, among others.</p>



<p>Vodafone Idea has also introduced new tariff plan for its pre-paid customers applicable from December 3. One of the biggest change is that Vodafone will now charge for calls made outside the Vodafone Idea network at Rs. 0.06 per minute.</p>



<p>Jio will be introducing new ‘ALL-IN-ONE’ plans with unlimited voice and data, effective from December 6, the company said in a statement on Sunday. These plans are said to have a fair usage policy for calls to other mobile networks. The new plans are expected to be priced up to 40% higher. Jio said that remaining committed to the consumer is in their ultimate interest, but the company will take all necessary steps to sustain the Indian telecommunications industry.</p>
