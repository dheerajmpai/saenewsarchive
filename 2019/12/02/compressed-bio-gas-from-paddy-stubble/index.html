Compressed Bio-Gas has properties similar to the commercially available natural gas and can be used as an alternative renewable fuel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Government of India has launched Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) initiative on 1.10.2018 to promote CBG as an alternative, green transport fuel for efficient management of biomass and organic waste. As part of the SATAT scheme, Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies, Gail (India) Limited and Indraprastha Gas Limited had launched Expression of Interest (EoI) for procurement of CBG from the entrepreneurs at an assured price. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Under SATAT initiative, as on 26.11.2019, 441 Letters of Intent has been awarded for production and supply of CBG. So far retail sale of CBG has commenced from two retail outlets. </p>
