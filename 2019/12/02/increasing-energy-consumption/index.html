<p style="text-align:justify">India is the 3rd largest energy as well as crude oil consumer in the world.  Increasing prosperity, higher living standards and burgeoning middle class are driving energy demand. India’s share in total global primary energy demand is set to double to 11% by 2040. To meet the increased requirement of hydrocarbon fuel, the major strategies adopted include; attracting investment in E&#038;P to enhance domestic oil and gas production, shifting to gas based economy, technological upgradation to meet refinery processes, energy efficiency and productivity, accelerating bio-fuel economy, expanding overseas oil and gas portfolio, diversifying oil and gas supply sources, driving infrastructure spending in oil and gas sector etc. As per BP Energy Outlook, 2019, the gas consumption of India in 2040 is estimated to be 185 billion cubic meters.</p>
