It became Act after it received the assent of President of India on 13th December, 2019. The government decided to bring this Act to provide for the regulation of recycling ofships by setting certain international standards and laying down the statutorymechanism for enforcement of such standards. The Government has also decidedto accede to the Hong Kong International Convention for Safe andEnvironmentally Sound Recycling of Ships, 2009.Accordingly, India has acceded to Hong Kong International Convention for Safeand Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships, 2009 on 28th November, 2019.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Recycling of Ships Act, 2019 restricts and prohibits the use orinstallation of hazardous materials, which applies irrespective of whether a shipis meant for recycling or not. For new ships, such restriction or prohibition on useof hazardous materials will be immediate, that is, from the date the legislationcomes into force, while existing ships shall have a period of five years forcompliance. Restriction or prohibition on use of hazardous materials would notbe applied to warships and non-commercial ships operated by Government.Ships shall be surveyed and certified on the inventory of hazardous materialsused in ships.</p>
