<p>AAP MLA from Okla Amanuthulla Khan has been found inciting violence amidst the riots in Delhi. The crowd that gathered in Jamia Millia University to protest against Citizenship Amendment Act later turned violent setting four buses ablaze. </p>



<p>“One can live without water…. But it is getting difficult to breathe, live with freedom, ensure safety of places of worship, walking with beard and skull cap and wearing burqas,” Khan said, addressing a gathering at Shaheen Bagh on Sunday afternoon, a few kilometres from New Friends Colony where buses were set ablaze and public property vandalized by organized riots hours later.</p>

<p>The Citizenship Amendment Act is meant to provide citizenship to the persecuted minorities in the Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. The act has nothing to do with the Indian Muslims as AAP MLA claims.</p>



<p>The police had earlier <a href="http://13.235.0.46/2019/12/17/jamia-violence-by-10-outsiders-was-pre-planned-petrol-bombs-used-confirms-police/">confirmed</a> that the violent protest at Jamia were pre-planned and not spontaneous. There were petrol bombs that were used to set fire to the buses. Four buses were set ablaze at four different places in Delhi within a time period of thirty minutes.</p>



<p>The Chief Minister of Delhi on the other hand has appealed the public to maintain peace in the City state</p>
