<p>The Congress&#8217;s Messaih had been in South Korea and has been nowhere visible in the country when the national capital was buring in riots. The students of JMI and JNU along with an external crowd had vandalised public property and had set buses to fire. While Rahul Gandhi was busy meeting the South Korean Prime Minister.</p>



<p>The Congress leader, apparently, discussed with the South Korean Prime Minister about the economic development of India and South Korea in long term. Incidently, within one hour of the meeting the South Korean Prime Minister stepped down as the PM and nominated the new Prime Minister of the country. This might not have anything to do with Rahul Gandhi&#8217;s meeting. But this is what a twitterati said &#8211; </p>
