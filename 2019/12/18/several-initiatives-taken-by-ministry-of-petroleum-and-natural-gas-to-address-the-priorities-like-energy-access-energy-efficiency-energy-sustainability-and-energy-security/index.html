<p style="text-align:justify">With the objective to provide clean cooking fuel to poor households, especially in rural areas ensuring universal coverage of LPG as cooking gas in the country, the Government launched Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) in May 2016, with an initial target of 5 crore. It was further revised to providing 8 crore connections to an adult woman of poor households by March, 2020, which has already been achieved on 7th September, 2019 i.e. 7 months ahead of the target.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Implementation of this scheme enhanced economic productivity and quality of life of women, by removing drudgery associated with collection of wood. The free time, thus, available with them, can be utilized in multi spheres for improving their life standards.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Government, as a measure of Good Governance, has introduced well targeted system of subsidy delivery to LPG consumers through PAHAL. The initiative of the Government was aimed at rationalizing subsidies, based on approach to cut subsidy leakages, but not subsidies themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">PAHAL Scheme was launched on 15th November 2014, initially in 54 districts. It was subsequently extended to rest of the country from 01.01.2015 for providing the direct benefits transfer of LPG subsidy to the bank account of the LPG consumers. As on 13th December 2019, 25.84 crore LPG consumers have joined the PAHAL Scheme and Rs. 1,22,666.82 crore have directly been transferred to the bank accounts of LPG consumers. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">PAHAL Scheme has been designed to ensure that the benefit meant for the genuine domestic customer reaches them directly and is not diverted. The scheme has helped in identifying ‘ghost’ connections, multiple connections and inactive connections which in turn has resulted in curbing diversion of subsidized LPG to commercial purposes. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Government notified ‘Reforms in Exploration and Licensing Policy, for enhancing domestic exploration and production of oil and gas’ on 28th February 2019, with the objective  to intensify exploration activities, attract foreign and domestic investment and enhance domestic production. The salient features of Policy Reforms are as under:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">approvals of Government/DGH/Management Committee and expeditious grant of approvals </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">During the year 2019, 32 blocks covering approximately 59,000 sq.km area have been awarded under OALP bid Rounds II and III and 7 Blocks with an area of approximately 18500 sq.km have been awarded under OALP Bid Round-IV.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Central Government has already granted Petroleum Exploration Licenses (PELs) for all the offshore blocks and also recommended to all the concerned State Governments to grant PELs for all on-land blocks allocated under Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) regime. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As on 30.11.2019, surface coverage of 41,902 Line Kilo Meter (LKM), out of 48,143 LKM has been achieved under NSP.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The NDR was established by the Government to assimilate, preserve and upkeep the vast amount of data which could be organized and regulated for use in future exploration and development, besides use by R&#038;D and other educational institutions. The operation of NDR was formally launched on 28th June, 2017 in DGH Office, Noida. Total data uploaded in NDR till 30 November, 2019 is 2.30 million line kilometres of 2D Seismic Data, 0.78 million square kilometres of 3D Seismic data and 17588 exploratory wells. The data availability in NDR will help investors to carve out blocks for submission of expression of interest under OALP.</p>
