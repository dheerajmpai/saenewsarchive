This means that over 1.25 billion residents of India have the 12-digit unique identity. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The achievement comes along with the rapidly increasing use of Aadhaar as the primary identity document by the Aadhaar holders. This is evident from the fact that Aadhaar-based authentication services have been used close to 37,000 crore times since inception. At present UIDAI receives about 3 crore authentication requests every day. </p>
