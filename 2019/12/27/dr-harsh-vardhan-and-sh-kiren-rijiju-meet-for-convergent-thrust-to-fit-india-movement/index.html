Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji earlier this year to encourage people to remain healthy and fit by including physical activities and sports in their daily lives”. This was stated by Dr Harsh Vardhan after he met Shri Kiren Rijiju, MoS (I/c) Youth Affairs and Sports yesterday, for charting the convergent actions of the two Ministries for greater visibility and synergy towards popularising fitness in the country in various age groups. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He added that the Ministry shall be engaging with all institutions of the Health Ministry along with other medical institutions and organisations such as IMA to create nationwide consciousness about fitness and wellness. The Ministry shall also actively engage with the state governments, the state Health Ministers and principals of various medical colleges. Additionally, this shall be taken forward with the frontline health functionaries that implement the NationalHealth Mission (NHM) in close association with the communities. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The thrust for popularising Fit India movement shall now see convergence of activities of both the Ministries, as the goal of this national movement is to encourage people towards positive, preventive and promotive health and wellness, Dr Harsh Vardhan stated. This becomes all the more significant as world over the burden of non-communicable disease is growing due to our changing patter of lifestyle. “Fitness forms an integral part of wellness, and with this in view we have already included various activities such as yoga, meditation, daily physical activities, jumba etc., in the Ayushman Bharat Health &#038; Wellness centres (HWCs) across the country”, Dr Harsh Vardhan said. In some states such as Gujarat, Shirodhara is also practised in some HWCs.“Even simple actions such as walking, cycling, stretching during our office and work hours, along with gyming and jogging help in keeping us fit and healthy”, he added.  </p>

FSSAI is also creating awareness about transfats in processed foods.</p>
