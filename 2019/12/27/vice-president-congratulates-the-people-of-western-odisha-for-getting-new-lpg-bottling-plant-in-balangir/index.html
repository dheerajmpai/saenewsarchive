He was also to attend the Platinum Jubilee celebrations of Rajendra College there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">But due to inclement weather in Balangir, the Vice President’s helicopter could not depart from Raipur airport. He waited for over three hours at Raipur airport but visibility still remained poor. Therefore, he conveyed his good wishes through an audio message.</p>
