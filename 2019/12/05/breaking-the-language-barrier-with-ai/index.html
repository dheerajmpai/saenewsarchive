<p>In a historic Man vs Wild adventure Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bear Grylls had their journey in one of the harsh environments of Jim Corbett. Bear Grylls, a British citizen did not understand Hindi. While the Prime Minister did not use a single word in English. It was the technology that broke the language barrier between Prime Minister and adventurer Bear Grylls in the Man vs Wild program. </p>



<p>With 23 officially languages and more then thousand local languages India is one of the most linguistically diverse nation. But with majority of the internet content in English Indians do face an issue with the language barrier. A <a href="https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/in/pdf/2017/04/Indian-languages-Defining-Indias-Internet.pdf">survey by KPMG</a> shows that, more than 50% of Indians prefer their local language over English to read or write. More than 60% Indian language internet users stated limited language support and content to be the largest barrier for adoption of online services. Around 68% Internet users consider local language digital content to be more reliable than English. </p>

<h4>Existing solutions</h4>



<p>Automatic translation with AI is one of the hot research that is happening right now. Indian companies like Reverie (acquired by Reliance) has the translation support for 9 languages. Google Translate provides also provides translation support for 9 Indian languages. </p>



<p>It has to be noted that there are multiple open-source NLP (natural language processing) solutions for several European languages while they do not have the support for Indian languages. StanfordNLP, OpenNLP, NLTK, Spacy.io are some of the open-source resources. While most of them have language supports for English, German, Portuguese, Spanish etc. but not for any Indian language (including Hindi). Though these solutions do not provide out-of-the-box translation they form the building blocks for the translation process. Hence adoption of these natural language solutions for Indian start-ups becomes much more challenging.</p>
