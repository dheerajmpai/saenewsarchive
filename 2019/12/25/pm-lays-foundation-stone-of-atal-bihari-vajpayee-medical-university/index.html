<p style="text-align:justify">The Prime Minister said that it is a privilege for him to lay the foundation stone of the institute related to health education dedicated to Atal ji since Lucknow has been the parliamentary seat of Atal ji for years. The Prime Minister reminded that Atal ji used to say that life cannot be seen in pieces, it has to be seen in totality. The same is true for the government, the same is true for good governance. Good governance is also not possible until we think of the problems in totality, in totality, he added.</p>

He said that construction of more than 1.25 lakh wellness centers in rural areas of the country is the key to Preventive Health Care. These centers, by catching the early symptoms of the disease, will prove to be helpful in their treatment in the beginning. Due to Ayushman Bharat, about 70 lakh poor patients of the country have been given free treatment, of which about 11 lakh are here only in UP, he added.</p>
