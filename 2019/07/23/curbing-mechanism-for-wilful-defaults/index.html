<p style="text-align:justify">RBI has apprised that there was an addition of Rs. 81,527 crore in the cumulative amount outstanding against wilful defaulters of Rs. 25 lakh and above, (as reported by PSBs and appearing on the website of TransUnion CIBIL), in PSBs over the financial years 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 (till December 2018). Recovery of dues from wilful defaulters takes place on an ongoing basis under legal mechanisms, which include, inter-alia, the IBC, SARFAESI Act and Debts Recovery Tribunals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">PSBs have been recapitalised through issuance of special securities amounting to Rs. 1,86,000 crore in financial years 2017-18 and 2018-19 and budget provision of Rs. 70,000 crore has been sought in the budget for the current financial year. These securities are subscribed by the investing banks to the full extent of the amount infused in each PSB. Thus, the funds for recapitalisation of PSBs are mobilised from the PSBs themselves.</p>
