However, if any producer/farmer gets better price in comparison to MSP, he is free to sell his produce in open market.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">            Government fixes MSPs for 22 mandated agricultural crops and fair &#038; remunerative price (FRP) for sugarcane on the basis of the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), after considering the views of State Governments and Central Ministries/Departments concerned and other relevant factors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">             As informed by the Department of Agriculture Cooperation &#038; Farmers Welfare, the Union Budget for 2018-19 had announced the pre-determined principle to keep MSP at a level of at least one and half times of the cost of production. Accordingly, Government had increased MSPs for all mandated crops with a return of at least 50 percent over all India weighted average cost of production for the season 2018-19. Government has recently increased the MSPs for all Kharif crops for 2019-20 season in line with the principle of providing at least 50 percent return over all India weighted average cost of production.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">             This information was given in a written reply by the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food &#038; Public Distribution, Shri Danve Raosaheb Dadarao in the Lok Sabha today.</p>
