Availability of doctors in public health sector varies from state to state depending upon their policies and context. However, Under National Health Mission (NHM), financial and technical support is provided to States/UTs to strengthen their healthcare systems including support for recruitment of doctors on contractual basis, based on the requirements posed by them in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs) within their overall resource envelope.
