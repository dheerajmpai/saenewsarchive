To address the problem, a Committee chaired by Lt. Governor of Delhi was constituted on 08.03.2019 with the approval of Union Cabinet, for recommending the process for recognizing ownership/transfer rights to the residents of UCs in Delhi. The Committee has submitted its report, based on which a draft cabinet note containing the proposal to confer ownership rights to residents of UCs has been circulated to all concerned for comments on 11.07.2019.  The proposal will confer/ recognize ownership or mortgage / transfer rights to the residents of UCs which will facilitate development / redevelopment of UCs soon in a big way.</p>
