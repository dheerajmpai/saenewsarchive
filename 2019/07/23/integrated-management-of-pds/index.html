The main objective of the scheme is to introduce nation-wide portability of ration card holders under National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA), to lift their entitlement foodgrains from any FPS of their choice in the country without the need of obtaining a new ration card, by integrating the existing PDS systems/portals of States/UTs with the Central systems/portals under Central Repository of all NFSA ration cards/beneficiaries thereby enabling One Nation One Ration Card system. The central repository also ensures that no duplicate ration card/beneficiary exist in any State/UT under NFSA. In this regard, so far Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) have been signed for the implementation of IM-PDS scheme with 26 States/UTs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">          Further, at present the State Governments of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Telangana, Tripura, Chhattisgarh (partially) and Madhya Pradesh (partially) have introduced intra-State level portability of ration card holders to lift the foodgrains from any FPS within the State.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">With a view to address challenges such as leakage and diversion of foodgrains, inclusion/exclusion errors, fake and bogus ration cards, Government is implementing a scheme on “End-to-End Computerization of Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) Operations”. The scheme comprises digitization of ration cards/beneficiary and other databases, online allocation, computerization of supply-chain management, setting up of transparency portal and grievance redressal mechanisms. As a result of use of technology in PDS operations, the State/UT Governments are able to delete/cancel a total of 2.98 Crore ration cards during 2013-2018.</p>
