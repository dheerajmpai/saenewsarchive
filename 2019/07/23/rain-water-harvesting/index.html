<p style="text-align:justify">Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) carries out ground water monitoring, four times a year, on regional scale through a network of observation wells in the Country. As per the pre-monsoon water level data (2018), the deeper ground water level (more than 40 meters below ground level) has been observed in the isolated pockets in some of the States/UTs. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Water being a state subject, efforts to conserve ground water including rainwater harvesting is primarily responsibility of States. </p>
