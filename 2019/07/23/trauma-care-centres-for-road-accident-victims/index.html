The overall objective of the scheme is to bring down preventable deaths due to road accidents by developing a pan-India trauma care network. The scheme provides for setting up  a designated trauma center at every 100 km on NHs. During the 11th and 12th Five Year Plans, about 200 Trauma Care Facilities (TCFs) were identified and financial support provided under the Programme. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Considering the shortage of medical and paramedical personnel in trauma care facilities, the scheme, implemented during the 11th &#038; 12th FYP, provided for financial support for manpower component to these facilities for a period of 3 years. Further, as per MoU signed with the states, the state governments are required to create permanent posts to undertake the liability of the contractual manpower recruited under the program, to ensure unhindered functioning of the trauma care facilities. In addition to this, various training courses are being provided for capacity building of the existing manpower in these trauma care facilities so that they can provide better healthcare services. These include Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) for doctors and Basic Life Support (BLS) for nurses. In addition, a Pre-Hospital Trauma Technician (PTT) course curriculum has also been developed under the Trauma scheme for paramedics to be posted in ambulances.</p>
