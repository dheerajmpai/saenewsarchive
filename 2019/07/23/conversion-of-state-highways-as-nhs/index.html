The total length of such notified NHs have been enhanced from about 91,287 km as on 31.03.2014 to about 1,32,500 km at present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways approved “In-Principle” declaration of about 71,898 km length of State roads as NHs since April, 2014 subject to outcome of their Detailed Project Reports (DPRs). Out of these, about 19,170 km length of State roads have been notified as NHs as per Section 2 of the National Highways Act, 1956.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Ministry considers declaration of some State roads as NHs, through publication of notification in the Official Gazette as per Section 2 of the National Highways Act, 1956, from time to time based on requirement of connectivity, inter-se priority and availability of funds, etc. The same is also applicable for State Roads approved “In-Principle” as NHs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Ministry persistently follows up with State Governments for their cooperation and pro-active participation in the process of land acquisition for development of notified NHs.</p>
