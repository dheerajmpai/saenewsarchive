Insurers save premium in good seasons/years and pay high claims, if any in bad years from the savings made in the good years. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Eighteen  General insurance companies including five Public Sector Insurance companies have been empanelled for implementation of the scheme and both private and public insurers participate in tenders invited by the State Government  for implementation of PMFBY and the selection of implementing Insurance Company is done based on the lowest bidder. Further, out of the total crop insurance business under the scheme more than 50% is shared by the five Public Sector insurance companies including Agriculture Insurance Company of India Ltd. </p>
