After being passed by both the Houses, the NIA now would receive the powers to investigate terror crimes relating to Indians and Indian interests abroad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Replying to issues raised by members of Parliament in RS on NIA (Amendment) Bill, 2019, Union Minister for Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah said that it is the responsibility of the Parliament to build a strong image of NIA in front of the world. The efficiency of NIA should not be degraded on political considerations, he said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Citing the sterling record of the NIA in terror cases, Shri Shah said that, as on 30.06.19, out of 272 cases registered, charge sheets have been filed in 199 cases; prosecution is over in 51 cases and convictions has been achieved in 46 cases. This is one of the best performance by global standards, he added.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Home Minister intervened when the Opposition raised the Samjhauta blast matter. He said that the case was politically motivated on religious lines and prosecution did not find any evidence against the accused. People were falsely implicated. The Home Minister asked, don&#8217;t they and their families have human rights and who violated it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Defending the independence of investigation agencies, the Home Minister said that under this Government, the investigation and prosecution agencies function independently and are never misused. Their functioning does not depend on political mandate, but on rule of law. Shri Shah reassured the House that no agency would ever be misused under this Government.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Shah said, till now India does not have the power to prosecute terror accused for perpetrating actress of terror against Indians abroad. The new bill should be passed with support of all parties and it should send a message to the world that India, as a Nation, and the Parliament is united behind building a robust NIA to fight terror.</p>
