<p style="text-align:justify">The efforts to prevent import of fake /counterfeit/sub-standard goods is an ongoing process. Under the Foreign Trade Policy, legal provisions exist to protect the Indian consumers and producers, as imported goods are subject to the same domestic laws, rules, orders, regulations, technical specifications, environmental, and safety norms.   The BIS standards applicable to domestic goods are also applicable to imported goods.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Central Board of Indirect taxes and Customs (CBIC) has taken a number of measures to prevent the import of counterfeit products in India, which are enumerated below:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Notification No.51/2010-Customs (N.T.) dated 30.6.2010 as amended vide notification No. 57/2018-Customs(N.T.) dated 22nd June, 2018 was issued to prohibit import of goods for sale or use in India, which are covered under specified legal provisions of the following statutes that regulate products with false trade mark, fraudulent or obvious imitation of design and false Geographical indication or product which infringe registered copyright. </p>
