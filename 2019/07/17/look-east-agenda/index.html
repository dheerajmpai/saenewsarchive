ASEAN-India Plan of Action (2016-20) adopted at the 13th ASEAN-India Foreign Ministers&#8217; Meeting held in Kuala Lumpur in August 2015 and endorsed by Leaders at the 13th ASEAN-India Summit held in Kuala Lumpur in November 2015, provides for a road map for cooperation between ASEAN and India across three pillars (a) political security (b) economic and (c) socio-cultural. A number of activities are held under the Plan of Action (2016-20) in all three spheres to promote ASEAN-India relations. A few of them have taken place in the North-Eastern states, e.g. ASEAN-India Youth Summit held in Guwahati, Assam on 5-7 February 2019. ASEAN-India trade in the year 2017-18 stood at USD 81.33 billion, registering a jump of 13.64% over the year 2016-17.</p>
