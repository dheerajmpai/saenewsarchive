<p style="text-align:justify">The Union Minister for Agriculture said that the first phase of Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana(PMGSY) which was started during the  Vajpayee government should have been completed by 2008 but the works were pending. In 2014 Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi had committed that first phase shall be completed by 2019 and 97% of it is completed till date. Of the second phase of PMGSY 50,000 kms roads are being made of which acceptance in principle has been given for 41,000 kms and 21,000 kms is completed.

<p style="text-align:justify">Enumerating the major challenges in the agricuture sector such as managing of scarce water resources, providing market connectivity and promoting agricultural exports, Shri Tomar said that amongst these the biggest challenge is management of water resources.

The Prime Minister in the latest edition of “Mann ki Baat” exhorted all the citizens of the nation to contribute towards water conservation. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Another big challenge the Minister highlighted was making agriculture profitable and viable since agriculture is one of the largest employers and India continues to be an agriculture based economy.

<p style="text-align:justify">The Agriculture Minister further said that the Prime Minister has given primacy to the progress of ‘Gaon, Garib, Kisan’ across the nation and the 140% increase in budgetary allocation for the Ministry of Agriculture &#038; Farmers’ Welfare in 2019-20 shows Prime Minister’s dedication towards achieving this progress.

<p style="text-align:justify">The Minister asserted that our farmer is not lacking in production but does not get fair price for his produce. He said that it is the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi led government which implemented the recommendations of the Swaminathan Committee which suggested MSP to be pegged at 1.5 times the production cost. Shri Tomar said that the purchase at MSP before 2014 was low but during 2014-19 maximum purchase is being made at MSP. Another key-point worth highlighting is that while earlier only wheat and rice were being procured but now pulses and oilseeds are also being procured. </p>

An amount of 87000 crore has been allocated for this scheme. Another big decision was the Kisan Pension Yojana which aims to provide pension to farmers who are more than 60 years of age.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In conclusion, Shri Tomar said that farmers will have a huge contribution towards building a new India which will be a 5 trillion dollar economy based on innovation, investment, institutionalisation, infrastructure and integration.    </p>
