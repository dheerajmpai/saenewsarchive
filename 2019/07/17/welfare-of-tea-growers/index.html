<p style="text-align:justify">As per TPDS, there is no provision of extending loans to tea industry or tea growers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The tea is mostly blended before it is exported, as such the origin (State/UT-wise) is lost in the process. Hence the data pertaining to the export share of the States and UTs are not maintained by the Tea Board.  However, region wise exports (based on the ports in the region) of tea during 2018-19 is given in the following table: </p>
