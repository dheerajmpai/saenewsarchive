The reason given by the Kamal Nath government was to &#8220;reduce the syllabus&#8221;. Several critics have said this is an intentional move by the Congress government in removing nationalistic content in the syllabus. It should also be noted that it was under NDA government the Kargil War was won. It has been a controversial move when the entire nation is celebrating the 20th Anniversary of Kargil Vijay Diwas on July 26th.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Earlier this year the government had restricted singing Vande Mataram which was relaxed later.</p>
