Public Sector Banks (PSBs), Private Sector Commercial Banks (in respect of loans given by their rural and semi urban branches only), Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) and Cooperative Banks on use of their own resources.  Besides, additional 3% incentive is given to the farmers for prompt repayment of the loan, thereby reducing the effective rate of interest to 4%.  </p>
