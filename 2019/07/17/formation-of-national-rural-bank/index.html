National Rural Bank of India.  Government has been receiving various representations from time to time in this regard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Government examined the proposal in consultation with the State Governments and Sponsor Banks and in the Action Taken Report on the recommendations in the aforesaid Report of Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance (2003), Government, inter alia, stated that “The proposal for consolidating the RRBs under a National Rural Bank or NABARD has not been favoured so far for various reasons.  State Governments and sponsor banks were consulted in a meeting taken by Secretary (FS) on 1.5.2004 on the proposal made by the select Group of CMDs.   Sponsor Banks were supportive of the proposal but most of the States favoured state level amalgamation without any additional financial support.”</p>
