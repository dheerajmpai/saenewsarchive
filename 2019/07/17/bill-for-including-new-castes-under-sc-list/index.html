The proposal was examined, as per approved modalities, in consultation with the Registrar General of India (RGI). As the RGI had not supported the proposal even on a second reference, the same has been rejected with the approval of competent authority. Amending legislation in terms of clause (2) of Article 341 of the Constitution of India is proposed in respect of such proposals of the State Governments/ Union Territory Administrations which have been favoured both by the RGI and the National Commission for Scheduled Castes.  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">During last 10 years, detailed ethnographic report in respect of 17 castes was received only once in the year 2013.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The RGI only furnishes his comments on the proposal. RGI does not ask for review of justification of the proposal. However, the modalities provide that proposal once not agreed to by the RGI is referred back to the concerned State Government/ Union Territory Administration to review and further justify their proposal in the light of comments of RGI. The proposal for inclusion of 17 castes in the Scheduled Castes list of Uttar Pradesh was rejected in the year 2015.</p>
