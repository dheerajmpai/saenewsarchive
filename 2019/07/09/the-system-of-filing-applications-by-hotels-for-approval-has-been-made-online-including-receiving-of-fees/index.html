<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">With a view to bring in more transparency and accountability, the classification/reclassification of hotels and project level approval by Ministry of Tourism, has been digitized with the introduction of http://hotelcloud.nic.in software in 2015. The payment of fees in respect of such applications are also received online.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The objective of the system is to ease the process of filing applications by hotels, thereby making the process paperless. The Ministry of Tourism endeavours to communicate the final decision on all such applications within 90 days of the receipt of application complete in all respects.</p>
