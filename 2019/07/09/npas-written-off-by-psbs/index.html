The total resolution amount approved in these cases was Rs. 65,320 crore. Provision held by PSBs in these cases was Rs. 33,556 crore as on 31.3.2019. PSBs provided for an additional amount of Rs. 21,727 crore, which amounts to 18.02% of the principal outstanding in these accounts.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Gains to PSBs are amply visible in their growing financial strength. As per RBI data on global operations (including provisional data for March 2019, as reported on 2.7.2019), gross NPAs of PSBs have reduced over the last financial year by Rs. 1,06,032 crore, record recovery of Rs. 3,09,568 crore has been effected over the last four financial years (excluding recovery in IDBI Bank Limited made during 2018-19), and domestic credit growth has risen to 10.20% during financial year 2018-19.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Growing strength of PSBs is also evident from the fact that all PSBs meet minimum regulatory capital requirement, 6 PSBs are now out of PCA restrictions, balance-sheets of PSBs have been cleaned up through transparent recognition of NPAs and their provision coverage ratio is at its highest level in seven years, and asset quality has improved sharply.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Note: NPA Figures cited above for PSBs include those for IDBI Bank Limited, which was recategorised as a private sector bank by RBI with effect from 21.1.2019.</p>
