The Department has received representations from stakeholders like Indian Dairy Association and Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation Limited, to reduce GST on some dairy products like ghee, butteroil and flavoured milk and to reduce import duty on some dairy machinery.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Indian cattle and buffaloes have among the lowest productivity in the world. Similarly there is a shortage of organized dairy farms and there is a need of high degree of investment to take dairy industry to global standards.</p>
