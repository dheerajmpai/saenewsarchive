<p style="text-align:justify">All CPSEs function under the administrative jurisdiction of concerned Ministry/Departments. The Board of Directors of a CPSE is responsible for regular review of performance of the concerned CPSE and to decide on steps to be taken for enhancing output/productivity of the company as per its operational needs and business plans with the approval of the competent authority. The concerned administrative Ministry/Department also undertakes periodic review of performance of CPSEs under their respective jurisdiction to facilitate policy interventions required for enhancing output/productivity of concerned CPSE(s).</p>
