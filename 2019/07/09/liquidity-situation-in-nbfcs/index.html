Further, despite this, better-performing NBFCs with strong fundamentals were able to manage their liquidity even though their funding costs moved with market sentiments. FSR also states that better-performing companies continue to raise funds, while those with asset-liability management and/or asset quality concerns are subject to higher borrowing costs.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">As per RBI, liquidity in the financial system turned into surplus in early June 2019, after a large injection of durable liquidity by RBI in the previous months. The liquidity surplus/deficit in the banking system is reflected in the net amount absorbed/injected by RBI under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) and includes Marginal Standing Facility (MSF). As per RBI data, the daily net liquidity progressively improved from an average daily deficit of Rs. 70,004 crore during April 2019 to average daily deficit of Rs. 33,400 crore during May 2019, and to average daily surplus of Rs. 51,710 crore during June 2019. As of July 3, 2019, the liquidity surplus had reached a level of Rs. 1,39,265 crore.</p>
