<p style="text-align:justify">The study addresses the issue of distribution of Human Resource for Health (HRH) in the country.  In India approximately 71% of people living in a rural area whereas 36% of all health workers are deployed in rural areas. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The density of the total health workers is estimated to be 29 per 10,000 population based on NSSO and 38 per 10,000 population based on the registration data, which is close to WHO’s minimum threshold of 22.8 health workers per 10,000 population. The study also reports a disparity in the density of doctors and nurses across the country. The number of doctors in Kerala and UTs is high as compared to larger states such as Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Bihar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The study used 2011-12 National Sample Survey data and projected Human Resource for Health (HRH) number for 2016 using census projection and worker participation rate. In addition the survey used 2017 registry data of health professionals (Medical Council of India, India Nursing Council, Dental Council of India and other professional associations).</p>
