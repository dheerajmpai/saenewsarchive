The consumer fora are empowered to give relief of a specific nature and award, wherever appropriate, compensation to consumers. Besides, the Department of Consumer Affairs is also running a National Consumer Helpline (NCH) where a consumer can call to seek information, advice or guidance and file complaints.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The number of complaints regarding online shopping after operationalization of online complaint filing from August, 2016 to March, 2019 in the National Consumer Helpline is 8373.</p>
