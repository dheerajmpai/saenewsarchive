The scheme has been instrumental in bringing new investment to the industry. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The ISAPM scheme has been launched in 2013 with an incentive @20% of the cost of machineries to jute mills and 30% to the MSME â€“JDP units. During 2014-15 to 2018-19, capital subsidy amounting to Rs. 4971.19 lakhhas been released to jute mills and JDP units.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Ten composite jute manufacturing units have been establishedin the last five years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The effective installed capacity of the industry is around 16.5 lakh metric tonne and around 11.5 lakh metric tonnes of jute goods is produced in the country. The difference in the production and capacity is due to labour related issues including shortage of labour.</p>
