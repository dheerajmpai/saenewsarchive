The occasion also provides a valuable and potent platform to discuss issues related to gender equality, maternal and child health, human rights, poverty and other development determinants”, he added. He stated that the Polio eradication campaign has also taught us that seemingly difficult things can be made successful with involvement of the society. “We have experience of the success stories and learnings from our challenges. We need to leverage on this knowledge and resources to achieve what we have set out for,” he stated. The Union Health Minister added that this year’s budget for the Health Ministry reflects the importance accorded to the health sector in the country with an increase of almost 19% in the total outlay.

<p style="text-align:justify">In his address, Dr Harsh Vardhan appealed to the NGOs and civil society organisations to devoteatleast one month every year towards the cause of population stabilisation.“Bringing an end to preventable child and maternal deaths, improving the health of our mothers and children cannot be achieved by working alone.  Governments, development partners, civil society, private and corporate sector, community leaders and the media, all have critical roles to play if we have to engineer the social change needed to achieve these goals,” he said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">At the function, the Union Health Minister also launched the new awareness campaign on Family Planning of the Health Ministry.  Noting the importance of information and communication, Dr Harsh Vardhan said, “the most effective way of achieving a health target is imparting good quality information and knowledge consistently to people and supplementing it with motivation.”</p>

He stated that population and health form the crux of the development process of any nation and Family Planning acts as a very crucial determinant. “The perks of family planning are not just limited to population stabilisation; rather it is one of the major contributors in ensuring good health for women, families and communities,” Shri Choubey said.</p>
