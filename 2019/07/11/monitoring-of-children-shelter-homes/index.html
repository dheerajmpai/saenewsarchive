The analysis showed that many CCIs use forms of disciplining children which fall under the ambit of corporal punishment as defined by the JJ Act. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">                   The Ministry shared the information with States/UTs drawing their attention towards the findings vide letter dated 4th May, 2017. The Ministry stressed upon the need for mandatory monitoring as prescribed under the Juvenile Justice (Child and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 which mandates regular monitoring by Child Welfare Committees, Juvenile Justice Boards and State Governments. The primary responsibility in execution of the JJ Act lies with the State/UT Governments. </p>

Further, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 provides for stringent punishment for persons who, being on the management or staff of a Home, commit sexual abuse on any child living in that home.</p>
