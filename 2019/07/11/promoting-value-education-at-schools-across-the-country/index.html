So far as the schools affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) are concerned, the Board has introduced Life-Skills education in the schools affiliated to it, which promotes inculcation of Values.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Values and attitudes are acquired and are best nurtured through experiences.  These experiences need to be consistent and inbuilt in the personal and social environment of the students. NCERT has, therefore, incorporated such concerns, wherever possible, in the textbooks developed for the various stages of school education. NCERT has also brought out a Value Education Framework entitled ‘Education for Values in Schools – A Framework’, which provides guidelines to schools to identify their priorities of values and plan their actions accordingly. NCERT has also developed a Resource Book for teachers called ‘Ways to Peace’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">CBSE has brought out Values Education Manual and Values Education Kit for classes I-XII. The Board has brought out Teacher’s Manual on Environmental Education and Adolescent Education, which help to foster values in children. CBSE also organizes Capacity Building Programmes in Values Education for teachers of its affiliated schools.</p>
