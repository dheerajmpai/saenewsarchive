For air connectivity, Government has laid down route dispersal guidelines with a view to achieve better regulation of air transport services taking into account the need of air transport services of different regions of the country. It is, however, up to the airlines to provide air services to specific places depending upon the traffic demand and commercial viability. As such, the airlines are free to operate anywhere in the country subject to compliance of route dispersal guidelines issued by Government. </p>
