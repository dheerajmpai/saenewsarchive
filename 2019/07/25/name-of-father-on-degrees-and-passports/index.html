<p style="text-align:justify">Further, this Ministry had written a letter dated 15.04.2016 to the Ministry of External Affairs requesting that inclusion of the name of the father be made non-essential if the mother and the child so desire. Before that, this Ministry had written another letter dated 24.06.2016 to the Ministry of External Affairs raising the problem which may arise before a divorced woman if she has to furnish a No Objection Certificate from her divorced ex-husband, who could also be the biological father for her child, if she has to obtain a visa of her such child.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">These letters had been written in light of the problems faced by women who are separated or divorced from their husbands or who are otherwise single, and who face hardships to get degree certificates, passports and visas issued for their children without inclusion of the names of the fathers of their such children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This information was given by the Minister of Women and Child Development, SmritiZubinIrani, in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.</p>
