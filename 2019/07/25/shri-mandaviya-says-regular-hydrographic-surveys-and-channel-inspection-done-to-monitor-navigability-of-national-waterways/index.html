<p style="text-align:justify">this is done through regular hydrographic surveys and channel inspection by regional and sub regional offices of Inland Waterways Authority of India.  Fortnightly hydrographic surveys are conducted to determine the available depth and possible shoal formations in the channels to determine safe navigability throughout the year.  A constant vigil is kept on the river regime behavior and accordingly appropriate river conservancy measures are taken to ensure fairways for safe movement of vessels. Based on the observation during channel inspection and hydrographic surveys, River Notices are issued and placed on Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) website with details of Least Available Depth (LAD), clearances at bridge structures etc. along with any specific information to be conveyed to shippers to assist them for safe transportation of cargo on the National Waterways.</p>
