<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As per Pr. AG’s presentation, State Government received GST compensation of Rs.1,589 crore for 9 months of 2017-18. In fact, there was a shortfall of more than 22% in GST collections compared to protected revenue of 9 months of 2017-18.  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The fiscal deficit to GSDP of the State has increased from 1.6% in  2016-17 to 2.4% in 2017-18, though it is still below the prudent limit of 3%.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The debt-GSDP of the State has risen continuously from 10.8% in 2011-12 to 18.6% in 2017-18. It seems that the debt pressures are slowly building up in the State, as can also be judged from the request of State Government, in its memorandum, to raise the level of debt to GSDP to 25%, to be met by State by the end of FY 2025.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As per Rural Health Statistics, 2018, Chhattisgarh has been facing severe shortage of human resources in health sector: 595 vacancies (91.2%) of specialists in CHCs against the sanctioned strength of 652; 434 vacancies (54.7%) of doctors in PHCs against the sanctioned strength of 793. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Out of 26 PSUs in the State, 21 PSUs had arrears of 28 accounts (ranging from 2013-14 to 2017-18) as on 30th September 2018 (as mentioned by  Pr. AG, Chhattisgarh). The Commission desired to know the cause for such large pendency.</p>
