State/UT-wise data of FDI inflow is not centrally maintained. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">There is no proposal under consideration of the Government to increase Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in multi brand retail sector in the country.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The retail market sector depends on a number of factors, including FDI. However, FDI is largely a matter of private business decisions. FDI inflows depend on a host of factors such as availability of natural resource, market size, infrastructure, general investment climate as well as macro-economic stability and investment decision of foreign investors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Under the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Policy, the details of norms for undertaking multi-brand retail trading in the country is given below:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">(i)    Fresh agricultural produce, including fruits, vegetables, flowers, grains, pulses, fresh poultry,fishery and meat products, may be unbranded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">(ii)            Minimum amount to be brought in, as FDI, by the foreign investor, would be USD 100 million.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">(iii)           At least 50% of total FDI brought in the first tranche of USD 100 million, shall be invested in &#8216;back-end infrastructure&#8217; within three years, where ‘back-end infrastructure’ will include capital expenditure on all activities, excluding that on front-end units; for instance, back-end infrastructure will include investment made towards processing, manufacturing, distribution, design improvement, quality control, packaging, logistics, storage, ware-house and agriculture market produce infrastructure.  Expenditure on land cost and rentals, if any, will not be counted for purposes of backend infrastructure. Subsequent investment in backend infrastructure would be made by the MBRT retailer as needed, depending upon its business requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">(iv)           At least 30% of the value of procurement of manufactured/processed products purchased shall be sourced from Indian micro, small and medium industries, which have a total investment in plant &#038; machinery not exceeding USD 2.00 million. This valuation refers to the value at the time of installation, without providing for depreciation. The ‘small industry’ status would be reckoned only at the time of first engagement with the retailer, and such industry shall continue to qualify as a ‘small industry’ for this purpose, even if it outgrows the said investment of USD 2.00 million during the course of its relationship with the said retailer. Sourcing from agricultural co-operatives and farmers’ co-operatives would also be considered in this category. The procurement requirement would have to be met, in the first instance, as an average of five years’ total value of the manufactured/processed products purchased, beginning 1st April of the year during which the first tranche of FDI is received. Thereafter, it would have to be met on an annual basis.</p>
