In the second stage, performance measurement is done based on parameters like crime prevention and proactive measures, disposal of cases, maintenance of public order, infrastructure assessment and citizens feedback. Personal visits are made by the surveying team to the selected police stations for this purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> The guidelines provide for awarding two sets of awards i.e. one for the top 3 best police stations in the country and another for the best police station in each State/Union Territory. In the last DsGP/IsGP Conference held in December 2018 at Kevadiya, Gujarat, the best 3 police stations in the country were awarded Shields. Certificates have been given to the top police stations of each state/UT.  </p>
