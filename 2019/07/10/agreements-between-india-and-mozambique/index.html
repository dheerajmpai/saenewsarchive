<p style="text-align:justify">The MoU was signed keeping in view the domestic prevailing prices and availability scenario and with the objective of promoting production of pulses in Mozambique and encourage trade of pulses between India and Mozambique. Under the MoU, both parties have agreed to target minimum yearly quantities of imports of pigeon peas and other pulses from Mozambique to India till 2020-21 whether through private channels or Government to Government (G2G) sales. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Government of India is committed to purchase pulses from Mozambique only to the extent of shortfall in targets of imports by private traders. Till now, no imports of pulses have been made from Mozambique on Government account under the MoU. The minimum agreed quantities of import of pulses from Mozambique under the MoU during 2016-17 to 2020-21 are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Year</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The import targets of pulses under the MoU are very small as compared to domestic production of pulses.  The Import of pulses did not have any significant impact on domestic farmers and miller community. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In view of bumper domestic production of pulses during 2017-18 and 2018-19, and Government of India’s commitment to ensure better prices for farmers, quantitative restrictions have been imposed on import of some of the major pulses to protect farmers’ interest. The import policy of Tur, Moong, and Urad was changed from ‘Free’ to ‘Restricted’ in the month of August, 2017. Peas was added in the month of April, 2018. The decision was based on the direction of the Inter – Ministerial Committee to review the prices of agricultural commodities.</p>
