NITI Aayog, in its three year Action Agenda, and the Sectoral Group of Secretaries (SGoS) on Governance, in its report submitted in February 2017, have recommended for induction of personnel in the middle and senior management level in the Government. Based on this, it has been decided, in principle, to appoint outside experts to 10 positions of Joint Secretary in identified Ministries/Departments and 40 positions at Deputy Secretary/Director level. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Advertisement inviting application from individuals for the post of Joint Secretary in ten identified Ministries/Departments was issued by DoP&#038;T. The entire selection process of the candidates was entrusted to Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). The UPSC, after conducting the selection process, has recommended nine individuals for appointment as Joint Secretary in nine identified Ministries/Departments.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">          No adverse effect on the morale of the civil servants has resulted from lateral recruitment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">          The appraisal of performance of all civil services officers (other than All India Services(AIS)) is governed by Government instructions. The officer reported upon submits his self-appraisal in the Annual Performance Assessment Report (APAR). The reporting authority, reviewing authority and in some cases the accepting authority record their remarks. The full APAR is communicated to the officer reported upon giving an opportunity to submit representation, if any, against the entries and the final grade in the report. The existing performance appraisal is consultative and transparent. </p>
