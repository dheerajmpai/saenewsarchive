<p style="text-align:justify">According to the Economic Survey, Food Inflation in the country has been extremely benign.  It stood at 1.1 per cent in April 2019 compared to 0.3 per cent in March 2019 and 2.8 per cent in April, 2018.  Food inflation based on Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI) declined to 1.8 per cent in 2017-18 from 4.2 per cent in 2016-17, 4.9 per cent in 2015-16 and 6.4 per cent in 2014-15.  Average food inflation for the financial year 2018-19 declined to a low of 0.1 per cent.  “The food deflation in the second half of FY 2018-19 is mainly due to deflation in vegetables, fruits, pulses and products, sugar &#038; confectionary and eggs, which together account for 13.1 per cent rate in overall CPI-C”, the Survey notes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Survey further states, “Food inflation based on Wholesale Price Index too declined over the last two financial years.  It was over 0.6 per cent in 2018-19.

<p style="text-align:justify">Drivers of Inflation</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">According to the Economic Survey, at all India level, CPI-C inflation during FY 2018-19 was driven mainly by miscellaneous group followed by housing as well as fuel and light group. The Survey further states that the relative importance of services in shaping up headline inflation has increased as it has contributed more than its weight. 40 items of services account for 23.37 per cent weight in CPI-C.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Measures to Contain Inflation</p>
