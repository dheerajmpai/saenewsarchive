Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the Economic Survey 2018-19 in Parliament today. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Deregulating labour law restrictions can create significantly more jobs, as seen by the recent changes in Rajasthan when compared to the rest of the states.  The Survey states no major labour reforms were initiated by the states from 2007 to 2014.  In 2014, Rajasthan was the first State that introduced labour reforms in the major Acts.  Thereafter, many States followed Rajasthan.  A comparison between the indicators for labour, capital and productivity of manufacturing firms makes it clear that flexibility labour laws creates a more conducive environment for growth of industry and employment generation.  The States which are rigid in respect of their labour laws are suffering in all dimensions and are unable to create enough employment and cannot attract adequate capital into their States.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">On average, plants in labour-intensive industries and in States that have transited towards more flexible markets are 25.4 per cent more productive than their counterparts in States which continue to have labour rigidities.</p>
