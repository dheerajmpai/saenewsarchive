<p style="text-align:justify">Education: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">According to the Economic Survey, as per Educational Statistics at a Glance (ESAG), 2018, the thrust on providing primary education has yielded results across social categories and gender. Over the years, remarkable progress has been made in respect of female participation up-to secondary level and Gross Enrolment Rate (GER) for girls has exceeded that of boys. For the first time, class wise and subject wise learning outcomes till class VIII have been developed to achieve quality in education. The Samagra Shiksha launched in 2018-19 aims at ensuring inclusive and quality education from pre-school to senior secondary stage.  Initiatives such as Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao together with ICT-driven initiatives such as e-Pathshala and Saransh facilitate an increasing outreach of the education system. The Economic Survey recognizes that transition to higher levels of schooling, high drop-out rates at secondary levels and shortage of teachers as main areas of concern.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Health: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Economic Survey states that Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) declined by 37 points from 167 per lakh live births in 2011-13 to 130 per lakh live births in 2014-16. The Under-5 Mortality Rate (U5MR) has declined at a faster pace during 2008-16 registering a decline of 6.7 per cent per year as compared to 3.3 per cent compound annual decline observed over 1990-2007.

<p style="text-align:justify">Skilling and Employment: </p>

<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">To measure labour market indicators at more frequent intervals, the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) was launched to yield annual estimates of the labour force on employment and unemployment along with quarterly estimates for urban areas.
