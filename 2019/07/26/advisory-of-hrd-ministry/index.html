On scrutiny of the relevant records of this Ministry, it has been found that no such letters have ever been issued by this Ministry in favour of so called Board of Higher Secondary Education, Delhi. Both these letters are, therefore, completely forged and fabricated. Further, it is abundantly clarified that No letters, whatsoever, have ever been issued by this Ministry recognising the said entity i.e. Board of Higher Secondary Education, Delhi.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The said entity i.e. Board of Higher Secondary Education, Delhi stands dissolved w.e.f. 01.07.1962 vide Directorate of Education Delhi Administration Resolution’s No. F.32(10)/62-Edn. dated 30.06.1962. Therefore, if any other document(s) is/are produced by the Board of Higher Secondary Education, Delhi in relation to its recognition, then the same may be deemed to be fake and the veracity of the documents may first be got confirmed from the concerned organisation/Ministry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The General Public, all students, their parents and all other stakeholders are, therefore, advised to take note of the above facts and act accordingly.</p>
