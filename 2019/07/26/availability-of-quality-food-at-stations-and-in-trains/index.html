The prescribed tariff of catering items has already been notified for both mobile and static catering units on Indian Railways. The notified menu and tariff are displayed prominently for information of passengers and is also available on websites of IRCTC/Indian Railways, in Trains at a Glance, Pantry Cars etc. “No Bill- The food is for FREE” campaign has also been launched by Indian Railways.</p>
