<p style="text-align:justify">The Department of Consumer Affairs has set up a National Consumer Helpline (NCH) for handling the complaints of the consumers. A consumer can lodge his complaint in the NCH through the toll free number 1800-11-4000 / 14404, sms, or online through the portal. “INGRAM” (www.consumerhelpline.gov.in). The complaints received at the NCH are forwarded to the companies/regulators/ Government Departments concerned for resolution. For quicker resolution of consumer complaints, NCH has partnered with more than 500 companies under its convergence programme. The complaints relating to the convergence companies are transferred to them online for resolution. In the event of a complaint not being resolved by a company, the consumer is advised to approach a Consumer Forum of appropriate jurisdiction established under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, a three-tier quasi-judicial mechanism, called Consumer Fora, has been set up at the district, State and National levels to provide simple, speedy and inexpensive redressal to consumer disputes. These quasi-judicial bodies have been empowered to give relief of a specific nature and to award, wherever appropriate, compensation to consumers.</p>
