<p style="text-align:justify">The Indo-Pak KargilWar was fought in May-July 1999 in the toughest terrain along the Line of Control (LoC) from ZojiLa in the West to Turtok in the East. The conflict was engineered by Pakistan by infiltrating its troops, occupying vacated dominating heights, overlooking and threatening National Highway besides violating the territorial integrity of the nation. The soldiers of the Indian Army, displaying utmost fortitude and resilience, fought legendary battles in Dras, Kaksar, Batalik and Turtok sectors at heights above 12,000 feet and evicted the Pakistani intruders. The Indian Air Force also contributed significantly and supported the Army operations.</p>
