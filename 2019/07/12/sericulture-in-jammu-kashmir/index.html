Besides, P4 Basic Seed Farm (BSF) Manasbal located in the state of J&#038;K is catering R&#038;D and extension needs. High yielding silkworm hybrids viz., Dun 17 x Dun 18, Dun 6 x Dun22, SH6 x NB4D2, SOH1 and improved mulberry varieties viz., S140, S146 and PPR1 have been developed by CSR&#038;TI Pampore to increase the farmers’ income through sericulture.  CSB is promoting bivoltine production program extending technical support through 6 clusters (including 2 mega clusters), besides extending state of the art of soil testing facilities. Due to the continuous efforts of the Institute and technology intervention, the average yield of bivoltine cocoons has been enhanced from 27 Kg/100 DFLs (1994) to 46.81 Kg/100 DFLs (2018-19).</p>
