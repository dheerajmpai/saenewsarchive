The Bill aims to prevent trafficking of persons, to provide care, protection and rehabilitation to the victims of trafficking, to prosecute offenders and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. The said Bill as passed by the Lok Sabha was then sent to the Rajya Sabha for introduction and passing. But, this could not be considered in the Rajya Sabha. Upon dissolution of the 16thLok Sabha, the Bill has lapsed. The Government is taking appropriate action for re-introduction of this Bill by following due procedure. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Trafficking of Persons (Prevention, Protection and Rehabilitation) Bill, 2018 relates to issues of sexual exploitation etc. only in the context of those victims, who may also be children, who have been trafficked. During the course of drafting of this Bill, the Government has had consultations with various stakeholders including Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and other experts and has taken their suggestions into consideration. </p>
