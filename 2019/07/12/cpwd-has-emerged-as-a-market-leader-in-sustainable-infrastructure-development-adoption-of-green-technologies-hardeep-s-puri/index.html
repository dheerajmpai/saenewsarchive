The development of the iconic ‘Sadaiv Atal’ Samadhi as a memorial to former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, in 45 days without cutting a single tree; installation of solar roof top panels on government buildings to help reduce their carbon footprint, and installation of wastewater treatment plants in Sir Visvesvaraya Kendriya Bhawan (Bangalore) for horticulture use – are insightful examples, the Minister said.  “Such an approach is critical for the Swachh Bharat Mission and the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation to achieve green and sustainable success. The organization has not only kept up with global architectural and sustainability standards, but has also assumed a leading role in formulation of these standards for institutions across the country”, he added. The Minister was speaking at the 165th CPWD Day function organized at Vigyan Bhawan here today.  ShriDurga Shankar Mishra, Secretary Housing and Urban Affairs, Shri Prabhakar Singh, Director General, CPWD and senior officers from all over the country were present at the function.  </p>
