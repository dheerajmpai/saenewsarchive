Calling upon their collective commitment to the country, Shri Gadkari has suggested in his letter that each small  enterprise can plant and maintain a minimum of 5 tress, each medium  enterprise at least 50 trees and micro enterprises can plant and maintain as many trees as possible for them. The trees should be of local variety, indigenous to the area like fruit trees, neem, peepal etc. They can be planted along national or state highways and district roads. Each individual enterprise should ensure that the plants survive and grow. </p>
