<p style="text-align:justify">The Government has increased mandatory reservation of foodgrains procured by State Procurement Agencies to 100%, thereby ensuring consistent demand of jute in the market and has also fixed a Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs. 3950 for the year 2019-20 and has instructed Jute Corporation of India (JCI) to procure jute from the farmers in case the market price goes below the MSP.  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Further, Jute I-CARE (Improved Cultivation and Advance Retting Exercise) scheme is being implemented by National Jute Board (NJB) with an objective to introduce scientific technique of cultivation and retting exercises by distributing certified seeds, nail weeders, seed drillers for improving fibre quality and productivity and thereby reducing cost of production. Around 1.93 lakhs farmers in 69 blocks have been covered under the scheme in the year 2018-19 and around 900 Metric Tonne certified seeds have been distributed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">There is no report of decline in the demand of jute products in Assam for lack of proper market as the procurement of especially the sacking bags has increased over the years and the two enlisted jute mills in Assam viz. Assam Co-operative and Atlanta Modular have been continuously allocated Govt. Orders for supply of jute sacks to State Procurement Agencies (SPA) under Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packing Commodity) Act, 1987.</p>
