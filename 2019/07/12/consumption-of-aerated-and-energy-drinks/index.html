Excessive consumption of energy and caffeinated drinks in a short period of time or when co-ingested with other stimulants such as alcohol may lead to health risks such as arrhythmias etc., however it may be relatively safe when consumed moderately and separately. A review published in Front Public Health, 2014 stated that the health risks associated with energy drink consumption are primarily related to their caffeine content, but more research is needed that evaluates the long-term effects of consuming common energy drink ingredients.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Further, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has formulated standards on ‘carbonated fruit beverages/fruit drinks’, ‘carbonated water’ and ‘caffeinated beverages’ under sections 2.3.30, 2.10.6(1) and 2.10.6 (2) respectively of Food Safety and Standards (Food Product Standards and Food Additives) Regulations, 2011.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The implementation and enforcement of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and Rules and Regulations framed thereunder primarily rests with the State/UT Governments. Regular surveillance, monitoring, inspection and random sampling of food products, are undertaken by the officials of Food Safety Departments of the respective States/ UTs to check that they comply with the standards laid down under Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, and the rules and regulations made thereunder. In cases where the food samples are found to be non-conforming, recourse is taken to penal provisions under Chapter IX of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">FSSAI is  promoting safe and healthy eating through several initiatives such as Safe and Nutritious Food initiatives focussing on social and behavioural change around food safety and nutrition at home , school , workplace etc;    Campaigns like ‘Aaj Se ThodaKam’  with focus on messaging for  reduced daily intake of salt sugar and fat  etc. It has nudged industry to reformulate products to provide healthier options.  It has also formulated a regulation with provision of front-of-packing labelling of High Fat Salt and Sugar (HFSS) Foods, as a measure to create awareness among people. The said regulation has been draft notified on 02.07.2019 for seeking public comments. In a unique outreach initiative, a pan-India cycle rally, Swasth Bharat Yatra launched on 16th October 2018, to spread the message of Eat Right, mobilised 21,000+ volunteer cyclists, covered over 20,000 kms and touched 2100+ locations in 100+ days, reaching out to 2.5 crore people.</p>
