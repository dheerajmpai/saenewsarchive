<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Smt. Sitharaman said that the first term of PM Modi-led-NDA-Government stood out as a performing Government, a Government whose signature was in the last mile delivery. Between 2014-19, government provided a rejuvenated Centre-State dynamic, cooperative federalism, GST Council, and a strident commitment to fiscal discipline. It set the ball rolling for a New India, planned and assisted by the NITI Aayog, a broad based think tank and has shown its deeds that the principle of “Reform, Perform, Transform” can succeed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">On many programmes and initiatives government had worked on unprecedented scales.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Pre- 2014</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">MSP</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Rs. 89,740 crores</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Rs. 1,71,127.48 crores(2018-19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Finance Minister said that mega programmes and services initiated and delivered during the last 5 years will now be further accelerated and sincere efforts will be made to further simplify procedures, incentivize performance, reduce red-tape and make the best use of technology to achieve the desired goals.  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Finance Minister elaborated that the Indian economy will grow to become a 3 trillion dollar economy in the current year and will reach the vision of Prime Minister to become 5 trillion dollar economy in the next five years. It is now the sixth largest in the world, while it was at 11th position in 2014. In Purchasing Power Parity terms, India is in fact, the 3rd largest economy already, only next to China and the USA. She said that to attain this and more the country needs to continue undertaking many structural reforms like the many big reforms in particular in the last 5 years in indirect taxation, bankruptcy and real estate. Even the common man’s life was being changed through MUDRA loans to help him do his business, and through several programmes it was being ensured that his/her kitchen had become smokeless, his/her house got electricity connection and women’s dignity was respected with the provision of toilets in homes. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Smt. Sitharaman said that gone are the days of policy paralysis and license-quota-control regimes. India Inc. are India’s job-creators and they are the nation’s wealth-creators. She said, “Together, with mutual trust, we can gain, catalyze fast and attain sustained national growth. I wish to propose a number of initiatives as part of a framework for kick-starting the virtuous cycle of domestic and foreign investments”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Referring to connectivity as the lifeblood of an economy, the Finance Minister said that the Government has given a massive push to all forms of physical connectivity through Pradhan Mantri Gram SadakYojana, industrial corridors, dedicated freight corridors, Bhartamala and Sagarmala projects, Jal Marg Vikas and UDAN Schemes. While the industrial corridors would improve infrastructure availability for greater industrial investment in the catchment regions, the dedicated freight corridors would mitigate the congestion of our railway network benefitting the common man. The ambitious programme of Bharatmala would help develop national road corridors and highways, while Sagarmala would enhance port connectivity, modernization and port-linked industrialization. If Sagarmala is aimed at improving the infrastructure for external trade, equally it is the poor man’s transport too. Waterways are proven as a cheap mode of transport. The Jal Marg Vikas project for capacity augmentation of navigation on National Waterways is aimed at smoothening internal trade carried through inland water transport. These initiatives will improve logistics tremendously, reducing the cost of transportation and increasing the competitiveness of domestically produced goods.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Finance Minister said that as the world’s third largest domestic aviation market, the time is ripe for India to enter into aircraft financing and leasing activities from Indian shores. She said, for providing an enabling ecosystem for growth in India of Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) industry, it is proposed to leverage India’s engineering advantage and potential to achieve self-reliance in this vital aviation segment. She added that the government will adopt suitable policy interventions to create a congenial atmosphere for the development of MRO in the country. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Finance Minister informed that Phase-II of FAME Scheme 2019, following approval of the Cabinet with an outlay of Rs.10,000 crore for a period of 3 years, has commenced from 1st April, 2019. The main objective of the Scheme is to encourage faster adoption of Electric vehicles by way of offering upfront incentive on purchase of Electric vehicles and also by establishing the necessary charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dwelling on the Railways, Smt. Sithraman said that it is estimated that Railway Infrastructure would need an investment of Rs. 50 lakh crores between 2018-2030.  Given that the capital expenditure outlays of Railways are around 1.5 to 1.6 lakh crores per annum, completing even all sanctioned projects would take decades.  It is therefore proposed to use Public-Private Partnership to unleash faster development and completion of tracks, rolling stock manufacturer and delivery of passenger freight services. She said that to take connectivity infrastructure to the next level, government will build on the successful model in ensuring power connectivity – One Nation, One Grid – that has ensured power availability to states at affordable rates and she proposed to make available a blueprint this year for developing gas grids, water grids, i-ways, and regional airports.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>

Enrolment into the Scheme will be kept simple requiring only Aadhaar and a bank account and rest will be on self-declaration. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Recognizing that investment-driven growth requires access to low cost capital, the Finance Minister said, India requires investments averaging Rs. 20 lakh crores every year (USD 300 billion a year) and therefore a number of measures are proposed to enhance the sources of capital for infrastructure financing: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">On the subject of Foreign Direct Investment, Smt.

She added that the Government will examine suggestions of further opening up of FDI in aviation, media (animation, AVGC) and insurance sectors in consultation with all stakeholders and suggested following measures: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">On a similar issue, the Finance Minister informed that even though India is the world&#8217;s top remittance recipient, NRI investment in Indian capital markets is comparatively less. With a view to provide NRIs with seamless access to Indian equities, she proposed to merge the NRI-Portfolio Investment Scheme Route with the Foreign Portfolio Investment Route.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Finance Minister said that Pradhan MantriGram SadakYojana (PMGSY) has brought many socio economic gains in the rural areas and its target for completion was advanced from 2022 to 2019, as all weather connectivity has now been provided to over 97% of such habitations. This has been possible by maintaining a high pace of road construction of 130 to 135 km per day in the last 1,000 days. She underlined that the PMGSY-III is envisaged to upgrade 1,25,000 kms of road length over the next five years, with an estimated cost of Rs. 80,250 crore.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Finance Minister said that ensuring India’s water security and providing access to safe and adequate drinking water to all Indians is a priority of the Government. A major step in this direction has been the constitution of the Jal Shakti Mantralaya, integrating the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation and Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation. This new Mantralaya will look at the management of our water resources and water supply in an integrated and holistic manner, and will work with States to ensure HarGharJal हर घर जल– (piped water supply) to all rural households by 2024 under the Jal Jeevan Mission.
