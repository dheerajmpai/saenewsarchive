<p style="text-align:justify">To meet the organizational requirements and enhanced user aspirations, rather than employing the conventional developmental framework, DGIS experimented with a new collaborative approach with Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) for developing the new MISO application.  Development work, under the aegis of MeitYstarted at Bhaskaracharya Institute of Space Applications and Geo-Informatics (BISAG), Gandhinagar which is a CMMI-5 level institute under Department of Science &#038; Technology, Government of Gujarat. In a short span of time, the experiment has paid rich dividends and has appeared as the panacea for undertaking automation of the IA at the fast pace. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">To formalize the entire developmental framework, structures &#038; methodology, Lt Gen Anil Kapoor, Director General of Information Systems and Colonel Commandant, Corps of EME and Mr M S Rao, President &#038; CEO, Ne GD inked a MoU on 05 Jul 19, in the presence of Shri TP Singh, Director, BISAG.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This signing of MoU is first of its kind inter-ministerial initiative between MoD &#038; MeitY and is sure to lead to similar joint frameworks for finding innovative solutions in the collaborative manner for the IA.</p>
