The statement of fiscal policy, as required under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003, laid in Parliament along with other budget documents by the Union Finance and Corporate Affairs Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman today, states that 4.23 crore duplicate, fake/non-existent, inactive LPG connections have been eliminated under this DBT scheme. Under the ‘PAHAL’ scheme, beneficiaries buy LPG cylinders at market rate and subsequently received subsidy directly in their bank accounts. Direct Benefit Transfer is a landmark initiative of the Government to ensure that benefits under various welfare and subsidy programmes of the country reach eligible and rightful beneficiaries. The document states that in addition, there are 1.86 crore non-subsidised LPG consumers, including 1.03 crore ‘Give it up’ consumers.</p>
