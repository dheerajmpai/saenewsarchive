<p style="text-align:justify">The Trade Fair offers a huge opportunity for the industry and business houses from India and abroad to build alliances, business networking, product sourcing and above all, interacting with the primary producers of a wide range of products and service providers. More details on IICTF may be seen at website www.iictf.in or at www.ictf.co.in . Online registration of the fair is operational on the website. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Cooperative sector has a big role to play in doubling agriculture exports from present US $ 30 billion+ to US$ 60 billion+ by 2022 as envisaged in the Agriculture Export Policy. Towards this end a Cooperative Sector Exports Promotion Forum has been set up in NCDC very recently. An estimated 94% of the Indian farmers are members of at least one cooperative institution. IICTF would be major platform to promote exports by cooperatives with direct benefits to their members who are mainly farmers, artisans, women, SC /ST etc. Promotion of exports of key commodities / value chain products that have high potential, duly backed by specific promotional initiatives including the involvement of stakeholder entities would be a definite boost for Doubling the Farmers Income and achieving the goals set under the Agri-Exports Policy 2018.</p>
