As per the existing framework, under various applicable laws, all banks including Public Sector Banks (PSBs) are required to have their annual financial statements approved by their respective Board of Directors, transparently disclose the same to stock exchanges, furnish copy thereof to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and present these at the annual general meeting of their shareholders for approval and adoption after discussion. As part of this, bank’s Board and shareholders discuss and review the bank’s performance and, in addition, markets and the regulator also take note of the performance, which serves to strengthen accountability by subjecting the bank to market discipline and regulatory supervision.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Further, bank-wise performance regarding implementation of reforms in PSBs for enhanced efficiency and strengthened arrangements for accountability is being tracked and measured through an independent agency, using an objective, transparent and publicly reported ‘Enhanced Access and Service Excellence (EASE)’ Reforms Index.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Further, all PSBs have a well-established vigilance mechanism headed by a Chief Vigilance Officer (CVO) directly appointed by the Government of India. CVOs of banks keep a close watch on various aspects of the bank’s functioning. RBI has issued various guidelines on examining staff accountability under various circumstances. As per RBI instructions on the internal control and inspection/audit system in banks, banks are advised regarding fixing of staff accountability aspect of irregularities, malpractices etc., at all levels, at the appropriate time. Further, as per inputs received from PSBs, PSBs impose penalty against erring employees after due process including dismissal/removal from service/ compulsory retirement from service etc. and complaint is lodged with the police or the Central Bureau of Investigation.</p>
