<p style="text-align:justify">Prior to GST, in the Constitutional Scheme, Shri Thakur said that taxation power with the Central Government on goods was limited-up to the stage of manufacture and production, while the States had the power to tax sale and purchase of goods. On the other hand, the Minister said that the Centre had the exclusive power to tax services. He said that this sort of division of taxing powers created a grey zone which led to legal disputes since determination of what constitutes a goods or service became increasingly difficult to synergise Central, State and Local Area levies. The MOS(Finance) said that in GST, the transition had been to levy taxes on supplies, and mechanisms to be brought in place in such a way that burden of GST does not fall on business but on the end consumption. By subsuming more than a score of indirect taxes under GST, the road to a harmonized system of indirect tax has been paved to make India an economic union, which has also significantly contributed towards higher efficiency and competitiveness, the Minister added. </p>
