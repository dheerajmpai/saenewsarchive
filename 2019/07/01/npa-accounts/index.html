<p style="text-align:justify">            Steps taken to expedite and enable resolution of NPAs and recovery from NPA accounts, include, inter-alia, the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">(1)        The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC) has been enacted, which has provided for taking over the management of the affairs of the corporate debtor at the outset of the corporate insolvency resolution process. Coupled with debarment of wilful defaulters and persons associated with NPA accounts from the resolution process, this has effected a fundamental change in the creditor-debtor relationship. In terms of RBI’s circular dated 7.6.2019 on “Prudential Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets” complete discretion has been given to lenders with regard to design and implementation of resolution plans, while providing for disincentives in the form of additional provisioning for delay in implementation of resolution plan or initiation of insolvency proceedings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">(2)        Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act has been amended to make it more effective, with provision for three months’ imprisonment in case the borrower does not provide asset details and for the lender to get possession of mortgaged property within 30 days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">(3)        Suits for recovery of dues are also filed by banks before Debts Recovery Tribunals. Six new Debts Recovery Tribunals have been established to expedite recovery.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">(4)        Under the PSB Reforms Agenda, PSBs have created Stressed Asset Management Verticals to focus attention on recovery, segregated monitoring from sanctioning roles in high-value loans, and entrusted monitoring of loan accounts of above Rs. 250 crore to specialised monitoring agencies for clean and effective monitoring, and created online end-to-end One-Time Settlement platforms for timely and better realisation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">            Enabled by the above steps, Scheduled Commercial Banks have recovered Rs. 4,51,857 crore over the last four financial years, including record recovery of Rs. 1,50,789 crore during 2018-19.</p>
