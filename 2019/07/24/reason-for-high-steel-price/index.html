ETR in India &#038; other countries is Annexed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Owing to non-availability of low ash content coking coal in the country, over 92% coking coal requirement is met through imports, and whose prices are determined internationally. In case of iron ore, imports meet only about 7-8% of the country’s total consumption and balance being met indigenously. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">MMDR Act, 1957 was amended in 2015 in order to streamline the allotment of Mining Leases in the country.  Presently all Mining Leases are granted through auction.</p>
