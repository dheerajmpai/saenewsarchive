Consequent to the adoption of the policy of zero tolerance against terrorism, security forces have been taking effective and continuous action in countering terrorism, resulting in corresponding change in the number of such incidents. The number of terrorist incidents in the Hinterland during the last decade as compared to the previous decade have reduced by 70% from 71 to 21 and the number of terrorist incidents in Jammu &#038; Kashmir have reduced by 86% i.e. 23,290 to 3187. </p>
