<p style="text-align:justify">Further, the 7th CPC has observed that the CCL as a welfare measure is seen as a benefit that has to be availed simply because it exists, and there is a palpable need to bring in some inhibiting factor so as to ensure that only genuinely affected employees avail of this scheme. Government has accepted and implemented the recommendation of 7th CPC in this regard that 100% of the salary shall be paid for the first 365 days of CCL, and that 80% of the salary shall be paid for the next 365 days vide the above notification.</p>
