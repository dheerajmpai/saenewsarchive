Chaturvedi, the then Member, Planning Commission constituted by the Government for restructuring and strengthening of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) had recommended setting up of a Aerospace University.  The recommendation has been accepted by the Government.  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">A Detailed Project Report (DPR) on establishment of Aerospace University was prepared by a HAL established Society named ‘Society for HAL Aeronautics Research &#038; Technologies Institute’ and approved by HAL Board. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">            Subsequently, the DPR was reviewed in this Ministry and it was suggested that for the formation of the Institute through an Act of Parliament, the structure should be in line with relevant Rules, Regulations &#038; Procedures in vogue in other Central Universities/Institutes.  HAL’s role would be facilitating the establishment of the proposed University and providing secretarial help. As regards managing the University/Institute, a separate well defined model would be worked out. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The time frame would depend on receipt of required clearances, approvals etc. from the concerned Ministries/Agencies.  Location can be decided based on the offer of land by the concerned State Government.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Requirement of approx. 200 acres of Land and Capital Expenditure of Rs. 592 crore are estimated for establishment of the University, in the DPR.</p>
