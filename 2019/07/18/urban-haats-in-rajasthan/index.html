A Project Approval Monitoring Committee (PAMC) meeting was held under the chairmanship of Development Commissioner (Handicrafts), wherein the proposal for construction of Sikar Urban Haat could not be considered as the State Government of Rajasthan had already been constructing Urban Haat at Sikar. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Further, the land proposed by Implementing Agency for setting up Urban Haat at Alwar was not found suitable by the committee. Accordingly, the implementing agency was requested to propose a new venue for setting up Urban Haat at Alwar. At present, three Urban Haats are functional in Rajasthan at Ajmer, Jodhpur and Jaipur.</p>
