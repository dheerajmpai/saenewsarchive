<p style="text-align:justify">Although entirely preventable and curable, Tuberculosis is a major obstacle to India’s human and economic development. India,in near future, is predicted to have world’s largest working population and a disease like TB which mostly affects adults in their most productive years, poses a great risk to the country’s economic growth potential. Apart from being a public health problem, TB is also associated with poor socio-economic development, marginalization and exploitation. The actions required to tackle the socio-economic and structural determinants of TB lie beyond the purview of the health sector alone, calling for a harmonized multisectoral response.</p>
