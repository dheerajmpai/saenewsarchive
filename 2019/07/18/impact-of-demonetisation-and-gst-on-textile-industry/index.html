The GST rates are lesser than the pre-GST incidence of taxes on these goods. To reduce the cost of garment industry, GST rate on manmade fibre yarns has been reduced from 18% to 12%. Further, the refund of accumulated input tax credit on fabrics has also been allowed to reduce cost of fabrics which is a major input for garments. Further, under the Interest Subvention Scheme, it was announced in the budget speech that ₹350 crore allocated for 2 per cent interest subvention for all GST-registered MSMEs on fresh or incremental loans.</p>
