<p style="text-align:justify">In this regard, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has informed that with a view to developing a sound framework and process for enforcement action, a separate Enforcement Department (EFD) has been established within RBI with effect from 3.4.2017 as a centralised department to speed up regulatory compliance. RBI has further informed that instances of regulatory deficiencies, including non-compliance with KYC/AML norms by private sector lenders and banks, are flagged in RBI’s inspection reports and pursued for compliance by RBI’s supervisory department. Some of the deficiencies and instances of non-compliance are taken up for enforcement action (in the nature of imposing a monetary penalty) by EFD in accordance with policy framed in this regard based on, inter alia, materiality of the violation. Since the creation of EFD, monetary penalty amounting to Rs. 148.91 crore has been imposed on 43 private lenders and banks for regulatory deficiencies, out of which penalty of Rs. 8.30 crore has been imposed on nine private lenders and banks for non-compliance with directions on KYC/AML norms.</p>
