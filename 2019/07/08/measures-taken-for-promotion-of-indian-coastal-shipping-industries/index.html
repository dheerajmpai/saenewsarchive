The said relaxation has given wider geographical spread for distribution of fertilizers for the benefit of farming community.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">He further informed that in addition, the Ministry of Shipping in exercise of power vested vide Section 406 (1) of the said Act, had allowed foreign flag ships chartered by a citizen of India or a company or a cooperative society to engage in coastal trade of India for movement of above mentioned cargoes without obtaining a licence from Directorate General of Shipping. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The licensing condition has been relaxed for certain type of specialized foreign ships due to non-availability of adequate number of such Indian flagged vessels.  Similar relaxation for specific cargoes/commodities has been made to make available additional vessels for carriage of cargoes on the coast at competitive freight rates.  This would encourage modal shift from road and rail transport to coastal shipping and eventually benefit the end-users. Both, the coastal trade and the transshipment of containers from Indian Ports, have shown an increase subsequent to the relaxation of licensing conditions for plying of foreign ships for specified types of cargoes.</p>
