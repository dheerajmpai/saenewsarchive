<p style="text-align:justify">          Further, the issue of fiscal transparency in the fiscal reporting of the Union and State Governments was discussed especially in the light of increasing trend of off-budget and extra-budgetary resource raising by the governments. CAG highlighted the fiscal risks due to non-transparency.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">International standards and amended FRBM Act, 2003 prescribes the inclusion of such off-budget resources to be included in the definition of debt. However, its completeness and reliability in the present form has been a concern for the CAG.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The CAG presented the details on the quality of capital expenditure by various levels of government and the underlying inconsistency in measuring and capturing capital spending.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The CAG also highlighted the need for reforms in government accounting by moving towards standard based accounting in the government.</p>
