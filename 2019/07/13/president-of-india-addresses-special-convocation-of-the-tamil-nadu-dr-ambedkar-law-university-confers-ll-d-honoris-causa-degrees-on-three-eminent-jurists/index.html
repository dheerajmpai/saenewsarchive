(Honoris Causa) Degrees on Three Eminent Jurists</h1><p style="text-align:justify">The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, conferred LL.D. (Honoris Causa) degrees on three eminent jurists – Shri Justice (Retd) P. Sathasivam, former Chief Justice of India and currently Governor of Kerala; Shri Justice Sharad Arvind Bobde, Judge of the Supreme Court of India; and Smt Justice Vijaya Kamlesh Tahilramani, Chief Justice of the Madras High Court – at a special convocation of the Tamil Nadu Dr Ambedkar Law University in Chennai today (July 13, 2019). </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Speaking on the occasion, the President said that as our nation, society and economy evolve, there is a need to enhance legal literacy and simplify legal rules.  It is important to not only take justice to the people, but also to make it understandable to litigating parties in a language they know. Perhaps a system could be evolved whereby certified translated copies of judgements are made available by the High Courts in the local or regional language. The language of certified copies could be Malayalam in the Kerala High Court or Tamil in the Madras High Court, as the case may be.</p>
