<p style="text-align:justify"> As on date, the Government does not propose to import Tur/onions. Government has taken various measures to ensure availability of pulses and moderate its price fluctuations. Such measures include initiatives for increasing production and productivity of pulses through National Food Security Mission (NFSM), promulgating appropriate Minimum Support Price (MSP) to incentivize production, etc. The Central Government has built buffer stock of pulses from which calibrated releases are undertaken from time to time to moderate price fluctuations. Pulses from buffer stocks are also being utilized by States/UTs under Mid-day Meal, Integrated Child Development Services and Public Distribution System Schemes. Further, Government has also signed a MoU with Mozambique in July, 2016 for assured supply of Tur and other pulses. In addition, trade policy with respect to pulses is suitably amended from time to time to appropriately regulate availability of pulses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Under Price Stabilization Fund (PSF), buffer of around 48,052 MT of onions has been built as on 23.06.19, for calibrated release during the lean season for moderating prices. The Central Government has offered onions from the buffer to States/UTs at no profit no loss basis to improve availability and moderate prices of onion during lean season. In addition, incentive on exports of onions under Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) has been withdrawn since 11th June 2019 to improve domestic availability and moderate prices. Government also closely monitors prices of pulses and onion for timely interventions in case of price fluctuations.</p>
