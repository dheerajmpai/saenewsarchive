The Civil list has been linked with the ER sheets. The List has been designed through DoPT, which gives multiple search options to the users. The Department of Personnel and Training is the cadre controlling authority of IAS officers and the Civil List is prepared with the help of inputs received from the States Cadres. The e-IAS Civil list is also available on the website of the Ministry at http:persmin.nic.in under the link https://easy.nic.in/civilListIAS/YrCurr/StartCL.htm</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">While congratulating the DoPT for this initiative, Dr Jitendra Singh said that this is an important step keeping in mind the Prime Minister’s priority to move towards digital functioning in the Government. This is also in line with citizen-centricity in working as it provides the information related to IAS officers in public domain which is accessible to the users from anywhere. The Minister added that other departments and ministries should also be encouraged to adopt this practice. Dr Singh emphasized that the State Governments should emulate this model to have a complete and systematic information about their respective state civil services officers. </p>
