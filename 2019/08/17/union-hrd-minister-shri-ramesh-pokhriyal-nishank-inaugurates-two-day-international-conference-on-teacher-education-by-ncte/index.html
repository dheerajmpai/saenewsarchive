<p style="text-align:justify">Speaking on the occasion the HRD Minister said that India has traditionally been known for leadership in education and teacher preparation. For thousands of years, ‘Indian Teacher’ was considered as Vishwa Guru (world’s teacher). Achievements of ancient Indian education system are legendary. School Education is the foundation of any progressive nation and teachers are the powerhouse of the society who mold and shape the future of students to become productive citizens of tomorrow and inculcate positive thinking and cultural ethos in them so that they can be an asset to the society, having both vision and a mission.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Ms. Rina Ray, Secretary, Dept. of School Education &#038; Literacy, MHRD, Govt. of India said “On August 22, 2019, the Ministry of Human Resource Development will be launching the world’s biggest project for teacher training named NISHTHA (National Initiative on School Teachers Head Holistic Advancement). More than 42 lakh teachers will be trained through this mission.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This initiative is in recognition of the fact that India cannot truly progress until and unless the skills of teachers are periodically upgraded. We have also mapped 15 lakh schools across the country on various platforms. In addition, 19,000 teacher training institutes in India have been mapped and put on Google Earth. Users can go online not only to see the geographical location of these institutes around the country, but also check their report card and give their feedback. Today, there are 8.5 million teachers in India, which is more than the population of Finland. We need to take care of our teachers and solve their problems. We need to focus on their welfare.” </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> Mr. Yaduvendra Mathur, Special Secretary, NITI Aayog said “The mandate of NCTE is very broad in its mission and vision and covers the entire gamut of Teacher Education Programs. Teachers are the pillars of transformation of the society, but it is important to upgrade their skills and ensure that they are trained in the best way. This is only possible in collaboration with teacher education institutions which play a key role in their actual transformation. Efficiency in teacher education is the need of the hour. International collaborations can play a key role in this.” </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dr. Satbir Bedi, Chairperson, NCTE, said “The teacher education system is responsible for preparing teachers for the school system, who would nurture and nourish the future generations. This conference has been organized to bring our school education system in alignment with global trends. It provides a platform to eminent educationist, academicians, thinkers, practitioners and administrators to brainstorm the various issues and challenges as well as solutions for the existing teacher education system in the country.”</p>
