<p style="text-align:justify">Speaking on the occasion, Dr Jitendra Singh said that the Government has a system of compassionate appointments where employment is given to the dependents of the deceased Government servants who have died before reaching their retirement. The appointments are given to the most suitable applicants based on their penury conditions and to support their livelihood. He expressed happiness and satisfaction that this pending process has been completed by DoPT. The Minister said that this is a human issue and this step will help these families in meeting their livelihood needs. He added that 18 such vacancies were there, out of which 9 have been selected and given appointment letters today. He conveyed his wishes to the candidates and encouraged them to work hard to contribute to the Government system.   </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The last such appointment was made during the year 2014 against the vacancies that occurred for the year 2011. Present appointments are being made for the vacancies that occurred since the year 2012 and onwards. In total, 18 vacancies occurred during these years, for which 18 applications were received. Accordingly, in order to ensure that appointment on compassionate ground should go only to the most deserving dependents, a Sub-Committee was constituted to physically verify their penury conditions. The Sub-Committee had submitted its report on 03.05.2019. Finally, the Screening Committee met on 15th May, 2019 to assess the suitability of the applicants on the basis of the Guidelines on Compassionate appointments. The Screening Committee also considered the report of the Sub-Committee and recommended 09 most suitable applicants for appointment to the post of MTS on compassionate ground against vacancies that have arisen since 2012.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Thus, a very important long pending issue of appointments on compassionate ground in DoPT has been resolved within a very short span of time for which the bereaved families of the deceased employees were waiting for last 7 years.</p>
