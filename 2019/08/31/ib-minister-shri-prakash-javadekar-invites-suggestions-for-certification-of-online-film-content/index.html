<p style="text-align:justify">The Union Minister for Information &#038; Broadcasting and Environment, Forest &#038; Climate Change, Shri Prakash Javadekar today unveiled the new logo and certificate design of Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). The launch was done at a special interaction between the film industry of India and board members of Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), organized by CBFC in Mumbai today. Ekta Kapoor, Kangana Ranaut, Sanjay Khan, Satish Kaushik, Madhur Bhandarkar, Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Boney Kapoor, Ramesh Sippy, Anupama Chopra, Subhash Ghai, Sudhir Mishra, Atul Kasbekar, Vidya Balan, Siddharth Roy Kapur, Prahlad Kakkar, Kiran Shantaram and Kunal Kohli were among the film fraternity present, apart from Secretary, I&#038;B, Shri Amit Khare and Chairman, CBFC, Shri Prasoon Joshi.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Addressing the film industry and CBFC board members, the Chief Guest and I&#038;B Minister Shri Prakash Javadekar said that the introduction of QR code in the new certificate design is in sync with the changed digital world. He said it will bring in greater transparency and provide richer information to filmmakers. He congratulated CBFC for the effectiveness with which it has been discharging its functions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Javadekar added: “When cable television and later DTH was introduced, people never imagined that prices of TV channels can be so low, but it will soon happen after the order of TRAI. These days, due to social media, with just one or two shows, it becomes clear whether a film will succeed or not.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Noting the importance of entertainment in modern life, the Minister made an appeal to all TV producers to use technology so that visually impaired people can understand the films better: “Such technology can be used at a cost of 1 or 2 lakh rupees per film. Similarly, private news channels should also try to bring out at least one bulletin per week for deaf people”. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Speaking about the upcoming golden jubilee edition of International Film Festival of India, the Minister said: “IFFI this year will be very special. The theme of IFFI 2019 is Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat. The opening and closing ceremonies will reflect this theme. I appeal to all to come and attend it. As our Prime Minister said, film is industry too; we are trying to have Film Business Summit, which will look into the business aspect of films. Film Bazaar is planned to be organized in Mumbai, which will look into business promotion, technology diffusion and export promotion”. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Javadekar informed that the Government is changing the Cinematograph Act, in order to curb piracy: “We earlier tried to protect the rights of artists by changing Copyright Act, now we are changing the Cinematograph Act so that piracy can be curbed”. He also invited suggestions and recommendations from audience and other stakeholders regarding certification of online film content.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Commenting on the new design, the Chairman, CBFC said: “I believe design should reflect the contemporary digital world and leverage the ease that technology has brought in our work processes. The design change is not cosmetic; it is extremely functional and underlines CBFC’s positive value-added approach.” </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In his talk, the Chairman highlighted various initiatives taken by CBFC during the last few years, for the benefit of the industry. He said that the Board has been playing an active and positive role in taking forward the issues of the film industry. The Board has brought in greater transparency and smoother processes. Filmmakers can find any detail about any film on tehw website of CBFC today, he said. AWBI (Animal Welfare Board of India) issues have been simplified. He added that the dialogic and consultative approach has resulted in a more collaborative process. He said that if we are anchored in collective human good, there is no way we will not be able to find solutions through a dialogic approach. He was extremely appreciative of his Board members who have been instrumental in taking this forward. The board comprises Narendra Kohli, Vidya Balan, Waman Kendre, Vivek Agnihotri, Gautami Tadimalla, T. S. Nagabharana, Vani Tripathi Tikoo, Naresh Chander Lal, Neil Herbert Nongkynrih, Jeevitha Rajasekhar, Ramesh Patange and Mihir Bhuta.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Speaking about the evolution of art, the Chairman said that historically, art used to be participative and built on the idea of cocreation. However, condescension entered into the field later, with the performer being active and the audience passive. Shri Joshi said that technology has now introduced a new reality of active performer and active audience, giving voice to the people. He said that when art goes out, the intent of the artist is sometimes not understood, due to different vantage points of people; this necessitates some extra effort to make oneself understood. Talking about culture, Shri Joshi said that cultural symbols such as language are a part of the collective subconscious and that their choice can only be decided collectively. He also said that trust between audience and creative people is paramount; if trust in artists is lost, it will have a harmful effect on our world. There can only be dialogue, not diktat, when it comes to cultural expression, this is the approach that has been adopted at CBFC, the Chairman said. He said that it is important to listen to the murmurs of the society, to be sensitive to the disadvantaged. Shri Joshi highlighted the need to educate citizens about the meaning of various film ratings.   </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The new design is futuristic in its approach and in sync with the new digital world. It is also interactive in its design sensibility: by scanning the QR code, more information on the certificate can be obtained online. Shri Prasoon Joshi himself has conceptualised the new look. The design has been done by designer Shri Rohit Devgun, with technical support from NSDL.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">On the occasion, the Regional Officer, CBFC Mumbai, Shri Tushar Karmakar presented an overview of the recent activities, initiatives and achievements of the organization. Shri Karmakar highlighted E-Cinepramaan, the online film certification system of CBFC, an initiative launched by the then I&#038;B Minister in March 2017, to promote transparency and ease of doing business. Frequently meeting the industry at different forums and creating opportunities for the film fraternity and the government representatives to meet and interact is also a step in this direction. The RO stated that the approach of the Board has led to improved mutual understanding &#038; appreciation by the film fraternity.</p>
