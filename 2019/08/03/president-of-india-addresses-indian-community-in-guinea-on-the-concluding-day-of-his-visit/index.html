<p style="text-align:justify">Addressing the gathering, the President said that given the complementary strengths of India and Guinea, there are numerous opportunities in trade and investment and for businesses to grow both ways. Development cooperation is a key element in our engagement with Guinea, from healthcare, fight against Ebola, agriculture, transport to energy security. He noted that the Indian Community in Guinea, though small in number, is vibrant and making significant contribution to the progress of this country. He said that in whatever capacity they may be in this country, each one of them has earned respect and a name for themselves and for India. </p>
