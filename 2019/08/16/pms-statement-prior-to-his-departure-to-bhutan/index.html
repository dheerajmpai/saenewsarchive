<p style="text-align:justify">“I will be on a State Visit to Bhutan on 17-18 August 2019.   </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">My visit to Bhutan in the beginning of the current term reflects the high importance that the Government attaches to India’s relations with Bhutan, our trusted friend and neighbour. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India and Bhutan enjoy excellent bilateral ties exemplified by our extensive development partnership, mutually beneficial hydro-power co-operation, and strong trade and economic linkages.  These are, reinforced by a shared spiritual heritage and robust people-to-people ties. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Both countries jointly celebrated the Golden Jubilee of the establishment of formal diplomatic relations last year.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India-Bhutan partnership today is of a special character and substance and forms an important pillar of Government of India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I look forward to having fruitful discussions with H.M. the King, H.M. the Fourth Druk Gyalpo and the Prime Minister of Bhutan on the entire gamut of our bilateral relations. I also look forward to addressing young Bhutanese students at the prestigious Royal University of Bhutan. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I am confident that my visit will promote our time-tested and valued friendship with Bhutan and consolidate it further for the prosperous future and progress of the people of both our countries.”</p>
