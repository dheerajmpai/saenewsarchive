<p style="text-align:justify">The Committee also pointed out that the employees’ call for 30 days’ strike was unprecedented, especially when Government has already agreed to their demand to hold discussions at the MoD level and is in process of continuously engaging with them. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Committee explained to the employee organisations that there is no proposal to privatise OFB.The proposal under consideration of Government is to make it into Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs), which is 100 per cent Government owned.  Rumours being spread that OFB is being privatised are misguiding and with the intent to mislead the workers. Corporatisation of OFB will bring OFB at par with other DPSUs of MoD.  This is in the interest of OFB as it will provide operational freedom and flexibility to OFB which it presently lacks.  Besides, the interests of the workers will be adequately safeguarded in any decision taken on the subject. </p>
