<p style="text-align:justify">The tribes constitute over 8% of the country’s population. This is a very significant number. In real terms it corresponds to over 10 crore Indians. The national object of inclusive development (sabkavikas) includes the development of tribes as an important component. Our constitution enjoins upon the Government the responsibility of addressing the special needs of the tribals. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As the name of this event Aadi Mahotsav suggests, it is the ‘adi’ factor that is important about them. The Adivasi way of life is guided by primal truths, eternal values and a natural simplicity. The greatness of the tribes lies in this that they have managed to retain the primal skills, the natural simplicity. Their creations issue from the depths of time. This quality gives their arts and crafts a timeless appeal. The crudest tribal handicraft instantly touches a primal instinct in all of us. This is particularly true of tribal music and dance.   </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The need is to put two and two together for a win-win result. Events such as this Aadi Mahotsav are very important in this regard. The Government has formed the Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India (TRIFED) for achieving this.   TRIFED is doing significant work in this direction and have now embraced e-commerce and digital platforms to take the business forward. At the Aadi Mahotsav , an effort tis also being made to take tribal commerce to the next level of digital and electronic transactions.  The Mahotsav apart from exotic handicrafts will also show case the electronic and digital skills of the tribals as a special attraction.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The tribal textiles manufactured by Master tribal Craftsmen from Jammu &#038;Kashmir in the North to Tamil Nadu in the South and from Gujarat in the West to Nagaland/Sikkim in the East will win people’s heart.  The Traditional tribal jewellery, bamboo cane also promise to be  the items of attraction.The Tribal handicrafts would be sold through 70-100 Stalls  under the Tribes Banner by tribal Artisans.
