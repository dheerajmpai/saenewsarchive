<p style="text-align:justify">About National School of Drama (NSD)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Established in 1959, the National School of Drama is the only one of its kind in India and is an autonomous organization, fully financed by the Ministry of Culture, Government of India. One of the foremost theatre training institution in the world, NSD was incepted under the aegis of the Sangeet Natak Akademi and became an independent entity in 1975. It offers a 3-year, full-time, residential training program in every aspect of theatre with a special focus on the practical implementation of theories. The enviable list of alumni and faculty members have ensured that the institution remains at the helm of performing arts – several theatre practitioners who passed from the prestigious institution, including playwrights, actors, directors, set and light designers and music directors, have enriched the Indian theatre and continue to do so. Apart from theatre, the artistic manifestations of NSD alumni have often left an indelible mark in other media as well. There are two performing wings of NSD – the Repertory Company and Theatre-in- Education Company (TiE) that started in 1964 and 1989, respectively. National School of Drama had been declared as deemed university by University Grant Commission in 2005. However, National School of Drama has requested the government to declare it as institute of national importance and therefore status of deemed university was not accepted.</p>
