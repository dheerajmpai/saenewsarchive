The book narrates the pictorial story of the life and times of Mahatma Gandhi through 550 photographs. It has been brought out by the Publications Division, Ministry of Information &#038; Broadcasting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Brief about the Books</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">With rare photographs detailing the life and times of Mahatma Gandhi, the books not only portray the birth of a shy boy, his early years and education, making of a Mahatma (in South Africa), his experiments with truth through his various movements–first in South Africa and then in India, but also the story of the intensive Indian Freedom Struggle of 20th century, of which he was the main architect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">For the first time, the Hindi version of the book has been brought out in order to cater to further the outreach and cater to a wider reader base.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This English version of the book was first brought out in 1954, taking photographs from the Sarvodaya Diwas Pradarshni organised at Rajghat in January 1949 to mark the first anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi’s death. This heritage publication, along with the new Hindi version, with photo support from National Gandhi Museum, has now been reprinted with better design and production quality.</p>
