He said, “I am deeply saddened by the untimely demise of Shri Arun Jaitley. His passing away is a personal loss for me. I have lost not only a senior leader of the organization but also an integral member of the family, whose support and guidance I have been receiving for years. Today his departure has brought a void in the country&#8217;s politics and the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is not possible to be replenished soon”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Home Minister further said, “With his unique experience and rare ability, Arun ji served various responsibilities in the party and the government. A brilliant orator and dedicated activist, he held important positions like the country&#8217;s Finance Minister, Defence Minister and Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“Arunji has left an indelible mark as the Finance Minister of the country during the NDA Government&#8217;s 2014-19 tenure by implementing Prime Minister&#8217;s vision for welfare of the poor on ground and placing India as the world&#8217;s fastest growing economy. He was a people-oriented person and always thought for the welfare of the common man. His every decision reflects this quality &#8211; be it the matter of taking action on black money or of realizing the dream of &#8216;GST – One Nation, One Tax&#8217; or be it demonetization. The country will always remember him for his very simple and sensitive personality”, Shri Amit Shah said.</p>
