<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">My visit to France reflects the strong strategic partnership, which our two countries deeply value, and share. On 22-23 August 2019, I would have bilateral meetings in France, including a summit interaction with President Macron and a meeting with Prime Minister Philippe. I would also interact with the Indian community and dedicate a memorial to the Indian victims of the two Air India crashes in France in the 1950s &#038; 1960s.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Later, on 25-26 August, I will participate in the G7 Summit meetings as Biarritz Partner at the invitation of President Macron in the Sessions on Environment, Climate, Oceans and on Digital Transformation. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India and France have excellent bilateral ties, which are reinforced by a shared vision to cooperate for further enhancing peace and prosperity for our two countries and the world at large. Our strong strategic and economic partnership is complemented by a shared perspective on major global concerns such as terrorism, climate change, etc.  I am confident that this visit will further promote our long-standing and valued friendship with France for mutual prosperity, peace and progress.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">During the visit to the United Arab Emirates on 23-24 August, I look forward to discuss with His Highness the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, entire gamut of bilateral relations and regional and international issues of mutual interest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I also look forward to jointly release the stamp to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi along with His Highness the Crown Prince. It will be an honour to receive the ‘Order of Zayed’, the highest civilian decoration conferred by the UAE government, during this visit. I will also formally launch RuPay card to expand the network of cashless transactions abroad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Frequent high-level interactions between India and UAE testify to our vibrant relations. UAE is our third-largest trade partner and fourth-largest exporter of crude oil for India. The qualitative enhancement of these ties is among one of our foremost foreign policy achievements. The visit would further strengthen our multifaceted bilateral ties with UAE.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I will also be visiting the Kingdom of Bahrain from 24-25, August 2019.  This would be the first ever Prime Ministerial visit from India to the Kingdom. I look forward to discussing with Prime Minister His Royal Highness Prince Shaikh Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa, the ways to further boost our bilateral  relations and share views on regional and international issues of mutual interest. I would also be meeting His Majesty the King of Bahrain Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa and other leaders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I would also take the opportunity to interact with the Indian diaspora. I will be blessed to be present at the formal beginning of the re-development of  the temple of Shreenathji- the oldest in the Gulf region – in the wake of the auspicious festival of Janmashtami. I am confident that this visit would further deepen our relationship across the sectors.</p>
