<p style="text-align:justify">Speaking on the occasion Shri Prahlad Singh Patel said that the art of diary writing is height of self discipline of an individual and habit of diary writing converts an ordinary man into extraordinary man.

He also urged NIA to translate the Diary of Manu Gandhi into other Indian languages with the help of Sahitya Academy so that the beauty of this book may spread all over the country.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Diary of Manu Gandhi originally in Gujarati has been edited and translated by Dr Tridip Suhrud, a well known scholar engaged in understanding the Gandhian Intellectual tradition. The first volume covers the period 1943-1944. Manu Gandhi (Mridula) was a grand niece of Mahatma Gandhi, daughter of his Nephew Jaisukhlal Amritlal Gandhi, and stayed with Gandhiji till his assassination. She was an aide to Kasturba Gandhi during her imprisonment in the Aga Khan Palace in 1943.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The first volume of the diary is a record of her life and times with Mahatma Gandhi between 1943-44. Authenticated by Gandhiji himself, the meticulous and intimate entries in the Diary throws light on his life as a prisoner and his endeavour to establish the possibility of collective non-violence. It further chronicles the spiritual and educational pursuits of a woman who takes up writing as a mode of self examination. She shares a moving portrait of Kasturba Gandhi’s illness and death. The author also expresses the deep emotional bond she had developed with Gandhiji.</p>
