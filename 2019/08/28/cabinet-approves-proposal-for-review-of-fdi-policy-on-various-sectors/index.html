<p style="text-align:justify">Major Impact and Benefits from FDI Policy Reform</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Background</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">FDI is a major driver of economic growth and a source of non-debt finance for the economic development of the country. Government has put in place an investor friendly policy on FDI, under which FDI up to 100% is permitted on the automatic route in most sectors/ activities. FDI policy provisions have been progressively liberalized across various sectors in recent years to make India an attractive investment destination. Some of the sectors include Defence, Construction Development, Trading, Pharmaceuticals, Power Exchanges, Insurance, Pension, Other Financial Services, Asset reconstruction Companies, Broadcasting and Civil Aviation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">These reforms have contributed to India attracting record FDI inflows in the last 5 years. Total FDI into India from 2014-15 to 2018-19 has been US $ 286 billion as compared to US $ 189 billion in the 5-year period prior to that (2009-10 to 2013-14). In fact, total FDI in 2018-19 i.e. US $ 64.37 billion (provisional figure) is the highest ever FDI received for any financial year.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Â </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Global FDI inflows have been facing headwinds for the last few years. As per UNCTAD&#8217;s World Investment Report 2019, global foreign direct investment (FDI) flows slid by 13% in 2018, to US $1.3 trillion from US $1.5 trillion the previous year &#8211; the third consecutive annual decline. Despite the dim global picture, India continues to remain a preferred and attractive destination for global FDI flows. However, it is felt that the country has the potential to attract far more foreign investment which can be achieved inter-alia by further liberalizing and simplifying the FDI policy regime.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In Union Budget 2019-20, Finance Minister proposed to further consolidate the gains under FDI in order to make India a more attractive FDI destination. Accordingly, the Government has decided to introduce a number of amendments in the FDI Policy. Details of these changes are given in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Coal Mining</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As per the present FDI policy, 100% FDI under automatic route is allowed for coal &#038; lignite mining for captive consumption by power projects, iron &#038; steel and cement units and other eligible activities permitted under and subject to applicable laws and regulations. Further, 100% FDI under automatic route is also permitted for setting up coal processing plants like washeries subject to the condition that the company shall not do coal mining and shall not sell washed coal or sized coal from its coal processing plants in the open market and shall supply the washed or sized coal to those parties who are supplying raw coal to coal processing plants for washing or sizing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It has been decided to permit 100% FDI under automatic route for sale of coal, for coal mining activities including associated processing infrastructure subject to provisions of Coal Mines (special provisions) Act, 2015 and the Mines and Minerals (development and regulation) Act, 1957 as amended from time to time, and other relevant acts on the subject. &#8220;Associated Processing Infrastructure&#8221; would include coal washery, crushing, coal handling, and separation (magnetic and non-magnetic)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Contract Manufacturing</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Single Brand Retail Trading (SBRT)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Digital Media</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The extant FDI policy provides for 49% FDI under approval route in Up-linking of &#8216;News &#038;Current Affairs&#8217; TV Channels. It has been decided to permit 26% FDI under government route for uploading/ streaming of News &#038; Current Affairs through Digital Media, on the lines of print media.</p>
