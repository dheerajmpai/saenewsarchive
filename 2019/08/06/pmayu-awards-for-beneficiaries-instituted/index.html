This special award for beneficiaries is likely to enthuse the States / UTs to fulfil the dream of house for millions, a reality, and also encourage beneficiaries to build their house aesthetically using sustainable methods. The winners will be awarded during a National level Event. The procedure of selection for these awards has been made transparent by linking it with the progress being uploaded in MIS system by States/UTs.  This award is in addition to CLSS Award for recognising the contribution of PMAY (U) Banks and Housing Finance Companies.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The Pradhan MantriAwasYojana(Urban)- PMAY(U)- Mission has achieved a significant milestone of approving more than85 Lakh houses against a demand of about 112 Lakh houses in urban areas. Out of these, around 50 Lakh houses are at various stages of construction and more than 26 Lakh houses have already been completed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The highlight of the PMAY(U) awards is that it will also recognise and reward the selected beneficiaries from each State/UT under ‘Beneficiary-led Construction’ component for building their house in a most aesthetic and innovative manner. To facilitate this, a PMAY(U) mobile application was launched by ShriHardeep S Puri, Minister of State (I/C)for Housing and Urban Affairs,in February this year for direct interface of beneficiaries with the PMAY(U) mission.The mobile app has been designed for beneficiaries to upload high-resolution photographs and videos clips highlighting their success stories of owning a house under PMAY (U). These stories are an emotional recount of experiences such as increased self-esteem, social upliftment, sense of pride and dignity, safety and security for the family, protected environment for girl child and children’s education. The mobile app has marked its reach to more than 50 thousand beneficiaries so far across all States/ UTs. </p>
