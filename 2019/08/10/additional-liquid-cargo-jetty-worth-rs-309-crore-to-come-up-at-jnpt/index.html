The project is being undertaken to cater to the increased demand for handling of liquid cargo like POL, LPG, edible oil, molasses and chemicals etc. in the country. It will provide berthing to ships carrying liquid cargo. The new liquid jetty will be built at a  cost of about Rs 309 crore. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Addressing the gathering, Shri Mandaviya said, “The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has laid focus on port-led development. Keeping this in view, India’s ports are being developed and modernized in line with global best practices.” </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“There is an increased domestic and industrial demand for liquid commodities like LPG etc in the country, with PM’s plans to reach gas stoves to every home.  The present liquid cargo capacity of JNPT is around 6.5 Million Tonnes Per Annum (MTPA). The new terminal for which foundation is being laid today, will increase this capacity by 4.5 MTPA.  This will help to better fulfill national requirements and be good for the port too ”, said the Minister. </p>
