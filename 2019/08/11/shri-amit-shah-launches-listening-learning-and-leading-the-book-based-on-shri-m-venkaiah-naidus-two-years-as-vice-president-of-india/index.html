Venkaiah Naidu’s two years as Vice President of India</h1><p style="text-align:justify">Union Minister for Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah launched the book ‘Listening, Learning and Leading’ in Chennai today. This book is based on Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu’s two years in office. The book captures glimpses of the Vice President’s 330 public engagements across the country during this period.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Talking about the book and his experiences from Life, Shri Naidu said that this book gives a glimpse of his life after assuming the office of the Vice President of India. He said, “I have retired from politics, but not tired of public life. Learn, Learn and Learn, then Earn. Even after you start earning, do not stop learning.” One must have conviction and commitment to what one does, connection with grassroots, patience to be successful in life and a zeal to bring a change in other peoples’ lives, he said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Naidu complimented the leadership and conviction of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi led government for the repealing of the Article 370. “It was the need of the Hour and was due for long”, he said while reading out a news article from 1964, quoting a demand from MPs in Parliament for the same. Shri Naidu also laid forth his views on reform measures in various fields that are required to bring effective governance in the country.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Talking about the venue of the event, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu said, “I have special love for the State of Tamil Nadu. The State is an important part of India. Tamil Nadu has been the leader of the cultural developments in the country and I have no hesitation in saying that I wanted this function to be hosted in Chennai. I am Vice President of the whole country, not only Delhi. The country includes North, South, East and West.” In his address, Shri Naidu also said that there should be no opposition to any language, but no language should be forcibly imposed on anyone. Everyone must give priority to their mother tongue, while showing an inclination to learn other languages as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Addressing the event, Shri Amit Shah said, “I have come here not as a Minister, not as an MP, not as a party president. I have come here as a student of politics, in honor of the personification of an ideal politician and leader, that is Shri Venkaiah Naidu. The book, ‘Listening, Learning and Leading’, is nothing but the story of his life and is an ideal for the youth of the country to follow. This has been exemplified in his conduct throughout his life, from a son of a farmer to the Vice President of India and Chairman of the Upper House of the Parliament. It is his dedication and untiring service for the Nation that has helped him to become a role model for the whole country, Shri Shah said. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Home Minister talked about the immense contribution of Shri Naidu towards his political party and the Government while he held various Ministerial portfolios in the NDA Government. Shri Shah mentioned that the concept of Smart Cities and the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana were launched during Shri Naidu’s tenure as the Urban Development Minister and how they are transforming the Indian urban landscape. The Home Minister added that even after becoming the Vice President, he has been as active as ever and has been continuously in touch with grassroots and has provided his guidance through his extensive speeches inside and outside Parliament. Being from agricultural background, Shri Naidu’s interactions with farmers across the country and his contribution to shaping the agricultural policy of India is commendable. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Further, Shri Shah noted that Shri Naidu has been active in getting India’s message communicated to the world by meeting visiting foreign delegations and visiting 19 Nations in the last two years, of which some countries have been the first ones that were visited by an Indian Vice President. The Home Minister said that the book is an example of how a leader needs to communicate with the masses of the Nation. It is for future leaders in all fields to tread the footsteps shown by Shri Naidu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Shah further noted that it is an auspicious happening that the young Shri Naidu who participated in movement against Article 370 in his youth, was the Chairman of the Upper House when the resolution was passed. He said, “I had no confusion in my mind as Home Minister of India on what would happen after Article 370 is abrogated. I am confident that Jammu and Kashmir would progress on the path of development and prosperity. Yet while introducing the resolution on Article 370 in the Upper House, I had apprehensions on how the House would function, as the Government does not have majority in Rajya Sabha”. Commending him for his neutrality and leadership during the discussion in Rajya Sabha on Article 370, Shri Shah congratulated Shri Naidu for his exceptional leadership in conducting the proceedings of the House, maintaining the decorum of the House and getting the resolutions and bills regarding J&#038;K passed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Event was graced by the Governor of Tamil Nadu, Shri Banwarilal Purohit, Union Minister for Information &#038; Broadcasting, Environment, Forests &#038; Climate Change, Shri Prakash Javadekar, Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Shri Edappadi K. Palanisamy, Deputy Chief Minister, Tamil Nadu, Shri O. Panneerselvam, eminent scientists like Prof M.S Swaminathan, Dr. K. Kasturirangan and Members of Parliament from various parties, among other dignitaries.</p>
