<p style="text-align:justify">Enumerating the major challenges in the Agriculture sector such as providing market connectivity and promoting agricultural exports, Shri Tomar said that amongst these one major challenge is farmers not getting proper value for their produce. For this he called for better coordination between the farmers and researchers in the field for improvement of agricultural produce. Indian products should be able to compete with products from across the world and thereby fetch best market value. Although farmers get subsidy and Government support, their aim should be not to solely rely on Government support but to take initiatives on their own to improve productivity.  Highlighting the importance of integrated and organic farming, the Minister said that the thought of farming as just growing grains should be changed to adoption of integrated farming wherein fisheries, poultry, animal husbandry and bee keeping etc. become part of farming. If every farmer starts doing this, the GDP share of agriculture shall increase.</p>
