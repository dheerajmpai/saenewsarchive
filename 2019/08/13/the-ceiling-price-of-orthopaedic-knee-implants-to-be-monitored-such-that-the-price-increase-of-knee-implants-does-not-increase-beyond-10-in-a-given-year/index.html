Subsequently, vide notification dated 13th August, 2018, the applicability of ceiling prices fixed for orthopaedic knee implants was extended for another one year,  up to 15th August, 2019.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Accordingly, the cost of knee implants was reduced significantly, upto 69%, resulting in a notional saving of Rs.1500 crore per annum to the consumers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The NPPA, in its meeting held on 8th Aug, 2019, reviewed the matter. It was noted that there has been an increased access due to knee implants becoming affordable. As per the data submitted by manufacturers and importers, an increase of 30% in the sales of knee implants has been reported during the period of July, 2018 to June, 2019. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The knee implant is a non-scheduled medical device / drug for which DPCO, 2013 allows an annual increase upto 10% of MRP. However, this was not permitted in 2018.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Though the industry has requested for a 20% (10% for the year 2018 and 10% for the year 2019) increase in the price of knee implants, it was decided to further monitor the price increase of knee implants as per para 20 of the DPCO, 2013 that restricts price increase beyond 10% in a given year. This shall be subject to a review after one year.</p>
