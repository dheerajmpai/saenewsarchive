<p style="text-align:justify">Before leaving for Brazil, Shri Javadekar said that India under the leadership of Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, is no more a back bencher but is at the forefront of environmental dialogue at the international arena. “When I went to Paris people were suspicious whether BASIC will remain intact or not. But we remained not only intact, but a force to reckon with in final negotiations, this time also we will review the status after Paris and what is the stand we need to take in UN session as well as next stop in Chile.”, said the Environment Minister</p>
