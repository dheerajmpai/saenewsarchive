The Prime Minister said that ‘Fit India Movement’ should become a national goal.

<p style="text-align:justify">The inaugural address was followed by a high-energy half-hour programme in which India’s rich indigenous heritage of sports and dance forms was showcased, and their importance in enhancing fitness was highlighted. Sporting activities like kushti, kabaddi, gatka, kho-kho, mallakhamb, kaliryapattu, and many others sporting activities have been instrumental in improving the fitness quotient among Indians. Besides, men and women have traditionally been involved in participating in various regional dance forms during festivals, which have also contributed towards the enhanced fitness. With technological advancements, fast-moving lifestyles and the advent of mobile phones, these indigenous forms of fitness are fast losing their popularity, but these can be a great way to remain fit. The show stressed on the need to give up sedentary lifestyles and be active in daily life. </p>
