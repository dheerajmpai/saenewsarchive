<p style="text-align:justify">Speaking on the occasion, the Union Culture Minister said that with increase of urbanization, development, growth and increasing population pressure, there is growing pressure on land including the land around centrally protected monuments. As this often affects the monument/site adversely it is important that such growth around the centrally protected monuments is properly regulated, balancing the needs of individuals and growth and development on the one hand and the requirements of preservation and protection of these monuments on the other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Minister said that this website will help common people substantially in line with the vision of Prime minister, Shri Narendra Modi regarding Digital India &#038;Ease of Doing Business. Many times people don’t know about the law &#038; they become the victim,this is a great step of NMA andour focus is to bring awareness amongst common man, the Minister added.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The details of States and Urban Local Bodies are as following-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Earlier this system was available only for five urban local bodies of Delhi and one urban local body of Mumbai.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Portal has integration with the Smart ‘Smarac’ Mobile App of Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), through which the applicant traverses his plot and the geo coordinates of his plot along with the images get uploaded into the NIC portal along with the proximity and the approval status.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">National Monuments Authority (NMA) under the Ministry of Culture, Govt. of India has been setup as per provisions of “The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains AMASR (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010”. In order to automate the process of grant of NO Objection Certificate(NOC) for construction related work in the prohibited and regulated area, NMA had decided to Design, Develop and Implement a web enabled Software (S/w) application named NOC online Application Processing System (NOAPS) and launched it in the public domain over the URL: http://nmanoc.nic.in/ . With the objective of introducing transparency, “NOAPS Non Single window system” was launched on 29th September 2015. Further, “NOAPS Single window system” was officially launched on Ist May 2016.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The applicant needs to fill up a single form which is being sent to the concerned agencies by the Urban Local Body, from whom No Objection Certificate (NOC) is required. NMA on its part will communicate its decision to the local body within 15-30 working days, bringing down the time limit from ninety days, as prescribed in Ancient Monuments and Archeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">By this integration, the National Monuments Authority has made a humble effort towards the Mantra of “Reform, Perform and Transform” given by Shri Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India. </p>
