You have to have an analogy to get the right prospective.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">At the onset of 20th century, Bengali Muslims were as radicalized as a large number of people in valley are these days. The 1905 Bengal partition was carried out on demand of Bengali Muslims backed by British[1]. After the partition was rescinded, the radicalization in Bengali Muslim community continued which virtually ensured a vast majority of the community members did not participate in the freedom struggle. When the idea of separate country was floated, the radicalized youth in Bengal promptly latched on to the idea. In the 1937 provincial elections separatist Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s party won the maximum seats (compared to other states) from the state of Bengal. In the following years, the radicalization in the Bengali Muslims increased and reached its crescendo in the year 1946, when on direct provocation of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, radicalized youth in Bengal massacred 4,000 in the city of Calcutta (what is known as Direct Action Day or The great Calcutta Killing)[2]. In the 1946 general elections, which proved to be virtual referendum for partition, Muslim league won by far the most number of seats (113 out of 119 Muslim majority seats) in Bengal. Even in the cradle of partition, the Punjab, the party could manage only 73 seats (it’s second best performance though). So it won’t be a hyperbole, if I say that the Pakistani Punjabi Sunnis were the driving force behind the partition, the Bengali Muslims acted as their lackey. Eventually Partition happened.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">WHAT DID EAST PAKISTAN GOT FROM THE PARTITION: KARMA</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Right after the partition, Punjabi Sunnis started showing their true colors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Pakistan was separated by 1,000 miles of Indian territory, with those on the West of Pakistan viewing those on the East as “impure” or “too Bengali”, creating a reign of hatred and violence that would span for several decades[3].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This is the confession of a Pakistani Army official, in one of biggest Pakistani newspaper.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Remembering 1971: A retired major tells the story he’d rather forget &#8211; The Express Tribune</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Before the 1971 Bangladesh liberation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Pakistan army killed 3 million Bangladeshi in cold blood in a span of months.Pakistani Army backed Imams and religious leaders publicly declared that the Bengali women were gonimoter maal (war booty) and thus they openly supported the rape of Bengali women by the Pakistani Army[4].Pakistan Army raped 200,000 to 400,000 women and children in a systematic manner.The rapes caused thousands of pregnancies, births of war babies, abortion, infanticide, suicide and ostracisation of the victims[5].America(then ally of Pakistan) controlled United Nations rejected India’s appeal to help Bangladeshis on Humanitarian ground.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> took a massive risk by helping Mukti Bahini, and thanks to political </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">turmoil in USA, India could pull off the operation successfully. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Ironically, Bangladeshis were saved by the same people against whom they</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> harbored religious hatred fanned by the Pakistani Sunnis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">EAST PAKISTAN VS KASHMIR : The curious case of Muhammad Iqbal and Shah Faesal</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Kashmir is witnessing something Bengal was witnessing between 1905 to 1946. The stooges of Hurriyat on direction from rogue Pakistan army are radicalizing youth and filling hatred against people of other faith. Mosques are used to legitimize the hatred and no wonder the Friday which should be a peaceful day is used by separatist to indulge in stone pelting[6]. Politicians and other opportunist take advantage of such situation. Take the recent example of Shah Faesal, the radicalized intellectual who resigned to satiate his greed for power which he tried to sugar coat as this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">If</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> you see he is trying to intellectualize hate against Hindus almost on </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">lines of what Pakistan Army is trying to do. Shah Faesal reminds of </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Muhmmad Iqbal, who after initially having won hearts of everybody sowed </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">seed of separatism.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Iqbal expressed fears that not only would secularism weaken the spiritual foundations of Islam and Muslim society, but that India&#8217;s Hindu-majority population would crowd out Muslim heritage, culture and political influence[7].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Both</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> Faesal and Iqbal are trying to obtain the same objective. Using </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">religion as a tool to fill hatred in impressionable young Muslim minds </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">against people of other religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Like Aga Khan, the separatist leaders are making a fortune by implementing Pakistan agenda[8]. This is how Agha Khan used to look, a typical money hungry middleman between British and radicalized Pakistan Punjabi Landords looked like:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The separatist radicalize youth to do stone pelting while their kids study in expensive foreign universities</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> similar to Aga Khan. Kashmiri separatist on direction of Pakistan army </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">were able to carry out massacre of Kashmiri Pundits in 1989 in an eerie </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">similarity to the great Calcutta killing(1946) done by Bengalis on the </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">direction of Jinnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Join Pakistan?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Join Pakistan, if you want to end up as another “East Pakistan” or a Baluchistan or Sindh. Heck, just see what is happening to Kashmiris in the Pakistan occupied Kashmir. The choice is between a country standing last in every single development index (except that of terrorism) living on largesse of China/USA and another country pegged to be a global leader in a matter of decades. Punjabi Sunnis didn’t even spare the Shias using whom (Agha Khan and Jinnah) they could form a separate country[9]. The love for Kashmiris by Pakistan Army is as genuine as it was for the Bengalis until they usurped their land. I won’t be surprised if Pakistan does another 1971 genocide on Kashmiris to foist their “Pak army version of Islam”,Should they get control over whole of Kashmir.</p>
