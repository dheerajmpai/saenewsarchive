The headline said &#8216;IAF plane shot down, pilot taken captive by Pak army&#8217;. The article was reported by Suhasini Haider and Dinakar Peri. The report did not mention that IAF has also shot down one F-16 of Pakistan. The report said &#8216;Government said IAF shot down F-16 of Pakistan while Pakistani Military denied any loss of any aircraft&#8217;. Clearly supporting to the Pakistani narrative.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Pakistan had claimed that they had captured two Indian Pilots. While later they changed their claim that only one Pilot has been captured.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Some reports say that Pakistani Aircraft had fallen in the PoK and Pakistan mistook it as an Indian Aircraft. The Pak F-16 Pilot had thought he landed in India and told he is an Indian when asked by a local. The local mob thrashed him black and blue to a semi-dead condition until the Pakistan Army came to a rescue. This misunderstanding led to Pakistan to claim two Indian Pilots were in custody, the statement that they took back later on.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Pakistan is bankrupt &#038; can&#8217;t afford a war. But Pakistan being Pakistan can&#8217;t refrain from attacking India through terrorists.Why are some journalists trying to propagate deescalation?Why do they don&#8217;t want to close the terror factory of the world?#PakPremiPatrakaar pic.twitter.com/rBVASOTgTwâ€” Rita ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ (@RitaG74) March 1, 2019</p>
