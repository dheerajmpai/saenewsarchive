The trend #GoBackModi had been trending in twitter whenever Modi had visited Tamil Nadu. Today it was trending at the 9th Position.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">But it turned out that most of the users who are posting #GoBack Modi were from Pakistan. In fact #GoBackModi was trending 9th in India(Image above) while 2nd in Pakistan(Image below). Clearly showing social media sabotage by the Pakistani Social Media Users. Apparently more than 58% of total traffic about Modi&#8217;s visit came from Pakistan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This was not the first time the Pakistani users have trended anti-Modi hashtags. Earlier in March 2017 #DalitLivesMatter trended for more than 24 hours. A similar plot was made when Maoist sympathizer was arrested. Times now had unearthed the sinister plot earlier in July 2018. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">A similar plot was done by Russia during the US Presidential Elections in 2016</p>
