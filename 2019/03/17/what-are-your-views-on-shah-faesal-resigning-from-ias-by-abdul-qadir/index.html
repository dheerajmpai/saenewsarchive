<p style="text-align: justify;">India you are considered a Hero, the moment you clear civil services or</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">IIT. And if you top the exam, you are a demi God. There is just too</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">much fixation for rankings in India. We forget that more than the</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ranking two things define a good civil servant:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His integrityHis performance</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shah</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Faesal’s have had an abhorrent and supercilious behavior for a long</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">time. Few months ago I wrote an answer and predicted, he will resign</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">soon after completing his course.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abdul Qadir&#8217;s answer to What is your viewpoint on the disciplinary action taken against Mr. Shah Faesal?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">the Govt was trying to counter the Burhan Wani propaganda instead of</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">being proud of being projected as a model youth he said the following</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">words:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Personal vulnerability apart, the very fact of becoming a part of a ridiculous debate is something which has disturbed me very much. Have I joined IAS to do a job or to become a part of your sadistic propaganda machine?&#8221;In fact when I qualified this exam I never thought of spending my whole life scratching the desk and if this nonsense around me continues, I might prefer to resign sooner than later,&#8221;[1]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">only his language is pathetic but you can feel he has more than</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">sympathy for the slain terrorist. And he was just looking for reasons to</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">resign.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He followed it up by using an isolated incident to insinuate whole of India as “Rapistan”[1]. Let me tell you that Pakistan army &amp; establishment is also trying to label India with the exactly same label in an attempt to defile India’s global image.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All this while he has been doing all sort of gimmicks like a typical politician to grab media attention. For example this story of his where he claims a colleague’s husband had sent a resignation letter and without due diligence it was accepted[2]. The story sounds fishy. Even if it is true, it’s an awful attempt to hide mistake of his department and project as if a lot of husbands are doing so. Faesal seem to have this problem of generalizing exception as norm as was the case in his “Rapistan” barb on people of India.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">THE RESIGNATION:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">you see the language he has used on the social media, it’s yet again</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">similar to the language used in Pakistani channels and Pakistan army</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">stooges that Hindus have reduced Muslims to second class citizens.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now here are few questions:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Why did he resign only after completion of his course (and not during it) on Indian Taxpayer’s money in an elite institution?Second</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">question is, if he feels that Muslims in India are subjugated than how</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">does joining the politics would change it. Because at the end of the</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">day, he would be following the same constitution that he was following</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">during his service stint.Third question is, what has his master</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Omar Abdullah (under whose patronage he was writing incendiary stuff on</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">social media) done for Muslims? If he has failed to do anything, what</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">he would do differently as his minion that will change the condition of</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">200 million Muslim ?Fourthly, if he feels civil cervices was</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">bad than why in the same facebook post he said “one of my task here</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">after will be train and guide aspiring civil servants to help him</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">achieving this dream”. Do you think people of India are some kind of</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">fool?Fifth why his language and terminologies on social media</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">have eerie similarity with those in Pakistan media and radicals in</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pakistan army? I wonder if he condemns the likes of Hafiz saeed, Afzal</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">guru, Burhan wani, Zakir Musa.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Clearly</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">this guy thinks he is smart and rest are fool. His behavior especially</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">his resignation post on social media shows lot of contradictions, and</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">lack of integrity. If he doesn’t condemn Burhan wani and terrorist</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">outfits like LeT, Hizbul as a terrorist, if he refuse to condemn terror</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">camps &amp; human right violations in Pakistan, one may feel he is directly or indirectly, knowingly or unknowingly acting as a wahabi stooge of Pakistan. Challenge him to condemn Burhan wani, Hafiz Saeed and Afzal guru as terrorist, I am afraid he will back out. It’s also a wake up call for the selection bench to have tougher mechanism</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">to filter out radicalized and hateful people like Shah Faesal in elite</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">services. The people from disturbed regions must be given home posting</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">only after they have spent considerable time in any other other part of</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">India. Also it’s a wake up call for others that topping the civil</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">services don’t make you a good civil servant. Performing your duties</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">with integrity is what makes you a good civil servant. For me a sweeper</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">or a peon performing his duties honorably is far better than a person</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">like Shah Faesal.</p>
