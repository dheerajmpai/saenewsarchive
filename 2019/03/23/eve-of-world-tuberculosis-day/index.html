<p style="text-align:justify">“I am happy to note that World Tuberculosis Day is observed every year on 24th March, to commemorate the anniversary of Dr. Robert Koch’s discovery of the Tuberculosis (TB) bacteria in 1882.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The theme of World Tuberculosis Day this year is “It’s Time”. Consistent with the spirit of this theme, India has renewed its commitments and intentions to end TB by 2025, five years ahead of the global targets. This is an ambitious timeline and, given our motivation to eliminate the disease, it is achievable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I urge all stakeholders to come together to achieve a TB free India. Let us re-dedicate ourselves towards achieving this goal”.</p>
