<p style="text-align:justify">This should obviously be confusing to a lot of people. Let me unravel the mystery if there was any.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Communism is a ideology which seeks to achieve atheism eventually. Like Xi Xinping recently said it’s compulsory for party members to be unyielding Marxist atheists[1]. And Indian communists are largely inspired by China. Wahabism is an ideology which seeks to achieve the exact opposite, and wants everybody to follow Wahabi version of Sunni Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">So</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> it’s natural for people to be flummoxed how a certain practicing Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> claiming to be follower of an ideology which seeks to eschew every </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">religion. Communism and socialism are similar in one respect that while </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Communism uses socialism as a tool, Wahabism uses religion as a tool for</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> political purposes. Communism and Wahabism even though have ideological</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> differences, there are certain similarities between the two.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Why the unofficial alliance: The common ground</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Communism</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> after initially finding popularity in 1920–80 is fast dwindling owing </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">to awareness of this violent ideology . Wahabism on the other hand is </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">struggling to find takers in India in large numbers. They occasionally </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">try to stoke fear in Muslim masses by carrying out “Deen bachao” (Save</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> Islam) rallies. It was largely successful in 1940s and those who came </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">under its influence ran away to Pakistan. Now they try to do that again,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> but a wooden pot doesn’t work twice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Communists</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> in majority will not tolerate Muslims like what happens in China and a </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Wahabi state like Saudi Arabia will not tolerate a communist.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">So what can be the common ground to forge an alliance?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Both</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> see a common enemy in nationalism, a philosophy of love for your own </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">country transcending all the cultural, ideological differences. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Nationalism has reduced communism to fringes and made the percolation of</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> wahabism in general public very difficult owing to both foreign and </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">violent character of both the philosophies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">So</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> both the struggling philosophies have kind of entered into an political</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> understanding finding a common enemy in nationalism. It’s very common </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">politics for foes to forge alliances. You can take example of recent </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">political development in UP where once sworn enemies Bahujan Samaj Party</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> and Samajwadi party forged alliance as both parties were facing an </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">existential crisis and found a common enemy in Modi. Same thing is </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">happening with communism and Wahabism.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The common mode of operation: Widen social faultlines</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Communism</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> carves out its political existence through social differences. It tries</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> to widen the social fault-lines. Wahabis have also the same agenda. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Recently Pakistani Wahabis senate think tank sat down to counter India </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">after strong reaction to Pulwama attacks. Check out the point number 8 </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">of the action plan finalized against India.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> objective 8 not only is similar to what communists do, but the </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">terminologies used are exactly similar that is used by communists in </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India. There appears to be an ideological understanding. The number of </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">hate spreading caste based leaders (like Mewani, Hardik Patel etc.) that</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> have sprang up just can’t be a coincidence. There is a conscious </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">attempt to counter nationalism by promoting linguistic, regional, caste </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">based divisions. Even certain journalists especially in outlets like The</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> wire etc. are unabashedly done caste and religious based divisions </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">exactly on lines of what the Pakistan think tank seeks to achieve. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shekhar Gupta who has worked with NDTV and is perceived as a congress </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">loyalist has written articles on his media start up from caste and </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">religious angles. Shekhar Gupta is now the President of Editors’ guild </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">makes it more worrisome.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">There is a conscious attempt from a group journalists gives an impression that a cabal as at work. Example.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The leftist realize that cricket is the main source of unifying India. So the following article appears an attempt to wrack it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Cricketer Muhmmad Kaif quickly saw what the vile journalist of Wire was trying to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Journalist</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> Ajaz Ashraf within days of passing of course of action in Pakistani </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">senate wrote the following article in a leftist “news” outlet Caravan, </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">exactly on line of point number 8 of the memorandum.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Urban upper-castes driving Hindutva nationalism have little representation among Pulwama’s slain jawans</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">So</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> if you find a Muslim claiming to be communist or a supporter of </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">communism, he would essentially be more political than religious. You </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">can take example of Umar Khalid and Shehla Rashid. I have had a </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">discussion with few Pakistanis few months ago and asked them if they </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">think Pakistani army general should ask China of to stop torturing </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">uighur Muslims in the concentration camps. The usual excuses were 1. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">China is an atheist state, so their action is justified. 2. It’s china’s</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> internal matter. China and Pakistan have found a common enemy in India,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> hence the political alliance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> have found Muslims claiming to be communists or supporter of communism </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">to be much more divisive than just communists. Their focus is more on </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">politics than religion. So don’t think they will refer Quran for their </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">actions. Hate for other religion is bigger than love for his very own </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">for a Wahabi. In fact both Communism and Wahabism is all about hate and </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">that’s the de facto religion.</p>
