<p style="text-align:justify">A</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> 20 year old Suicide Bomber rammed his explosive laden bus into CRPF </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">(Central Reserve Police Force) Bus and causing the biggest loss of life </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">of our forces since 2010. Suicide bombing is not a new phenomenon. It </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">has happened in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan etc. But for the first time in </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India. So it becomes important to analyze what ideology drove him to be a</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> suicide bomber.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I was reading about this guy and came to know that he was working at a saw mill. He then took up courses of religious studies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dar had studied till Class 12 and then taken a course in religious studies. “He wanted to become a cleric and had already memorised eight chapters of the Quran,” said his father[1].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Within months of joining the religious course, the timid, guy disappears and became a suicide bomber. I was watching the video of the suicide bomber which he had posted before blowing himself up[2].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Using Quranic words to justify hate against a community:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He was repeatedly using the terms like Mushriek</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> (Polytheist or somebody who prays another god other than Allah), which </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">are mentioned in the Quran, in a contemptuous way to describe an Indian </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">community. He was repeatedly using the term “gaay ka pishab peene wale” (Cow urine drinkers), something the Wahabis in</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> Pakistan to justify their superiority over Indian Hindus. Apparently, </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">he was in touch of somebody who was a Pakistani or had a great influence</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> of Pakistan where he had picked up that lingo.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The lure of Hoors: A bait for a suicide bomber</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In one of his opening statement the Pulwama bomber had a word of advise</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> Apne kirdaar ko bedaag rakho, jannat ki hoorein tumhara muntazir </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">rahein” (Keep your character so clean, that the virgins in Heaven yearn </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">for you)…..(Pulwama Bomber)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This may sound preposterous or even hilarious to some, but a lot of Muslims particularly Wahabi Muslims believe that a martyr for Islam is awarded with 72 hoors up in heaven by Allah. This notion has been reinforced by influential Wahabi terror ideologues like Zakir Naik in their programme[3]. Zakir Naik in fact has justified Suicide Bombing as a last resort, under guidance of a “learned man”[4]. Why I am citing Zakir Naik is because he has gained a cult status among W ahabis and they actually cites his interpretation as a reference.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Wahabism: the political ideology to use religion for political purposes</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Wahabism</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> works by spreading hate against all other religions and use religion as</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> a tool to turn followers into a hateful army. The hate is further </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">channelized by the certain “religious” politicians to motivate gullible </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">youths into doing terror acts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">For example the “hoor in heaven for Martyrdom” Philosophyhas</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> been successfully used to recruit youth frustrated with life to </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">channelize their frustration in terror acts. This single ideology has </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">lured so many youths into doing suicide bombing. As we can see in the </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">video of the Pulwama bomber, how solemnly he says he will be getting </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">hoors in heaven.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">An attack similar to Pulwama happened on Iranian army which took lives of 27 Revolutionary guard[5]. And the attack happened on the same date. Like the Kashmiri terror attack was carried out by Jaish e Muhmmad, the attack in Iran was by a sunni terror group Jaish al-Adl (Army of Justice) which has found refuge in Pakistan. May be it was to gain praise from Saudi Arabian crown prince who was scheduled to to visit Pakistan and dislikes Iran.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">So</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> it has to be accepted that attack was religiously motivated and </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">manifestation of growing Wahabism in Kashmir. In Pakistan, the </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">environment of radicalization is so grim that not one major celebrity in</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> Pakistan condemned the loss of lives in Pulwama just like what happened</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> during the Uri attack. Even those like Rahat Fateh Ali khan, Atif Asal </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">and Ali Zafar who earned so much from India have shown no remorse at the</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> attack. Now humanity in Kashmiris fast eroding like Pakistan and the </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">suicide bombing and its brazen celebration by few youths is a </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">manifestation of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I think its the responsibility of the Islamic scholars and clerics to counter the hateful ideologies. Ask them can the Quranic meaning of Mushrik can mean Hindu as the Pakistanis and radical Kashmiris are trying to project? Because if it can be then, they can easily misuse the verses ( e.g. 9:5 )to justify the Pulwama attacks to radical low idiots like Adil Ahmad. Ask them can drinking of cow urine as medicine be used to look down upon Hindus? Ask them that do they know that Prophet had recommended camel urine as a medicine and that in Gulf countries camel urine is actually consumed[6][7]? How different is cow urine than camel urine?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This matter has gone out of hand, and if such hateful philosophies and myth are not countered publicly, a lot of stupid fellows may fall pray to terror ideologues like Zakir Naik and Hafiz Saeed. First start by countering the hoor for martyrdom philosophy which is inspiring suicide bombers.</p>
