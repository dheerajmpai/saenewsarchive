<p style="text-align:justify">Conference of Ministers and Secretaries of the States and Union Territories in charge of Youth Affairs and Sports was held in New Delhi today. In his inaugural address, the Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports(I/C) Shri Kiren Rijiju called for collective efforts of the centre and the states in making India a fit nation and encouraging the sporting culture in the country. He said that India is a young nation, and we have to channelise the energy of youth for the national development. Calling upon the states to sync their activities with the centre’s programmes, Shri Rijiju said that the centre and the states should work as a team. “The Youth Affairs and Sports departments have large Human capital at their disposal, which more than makes up for the dearth of the financial resources. We should recognize our strength. There are over 80 lakh volunteers working in various programmes of the Centre. On 2nd October this year, over 24 lakh volunteers participated in the plogging programme, making it one of the largest human participation in the world in a single programme.”</p>
