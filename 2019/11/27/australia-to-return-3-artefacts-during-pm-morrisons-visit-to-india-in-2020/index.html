<p>A pair of ‘Dwarapala’ or door guardians from 15th century Tamil Nadu and a 6th century sculpture of serpent king ‘Nagaraja’ with origins in either Rajasthan or Madhya Pradesh are among the three artefacts, which will be returned to India during Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s visit to India next year.</p>



<p>Both India and Australia are parties to the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transport of Ownership of Cultural Property.</p>



<p>Criminal law proceedings are currently underway in India and the United States against former New York art dealer Subhash Kapoor, from whom these artefacts were purchased although the Australian government doesn’t have any role in these proceedings.</p>



<p>The artefacts were held by the National Gallery of Australia, were purchased in good faith, but extensive research undertaken by the Gallery has led to its decision to voluntarily return these artefacts to India.</p>
