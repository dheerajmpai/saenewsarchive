The Government has amended the Child Labour (Prohibition &#038; Regulation) Act, 1986 and enacted the Child Labour (Prohibition &#038; Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 which came into force with effect from 01.09.2016. The Amendment Act inter-alia provides for complete prohibition of work or employment of children below 14 years of age in any occupation and process and prohibition of adolescents in the age group of 14 to 18 years in hazardous occupations and processes. The Amendment Act also provides the stricter punishment for employers for violation of the Act and has made the offence as cognizable. As per provisions contained in the Act, whoever employs any child or permits any child to work in contravention shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than six month but which may extend to two years, or with fine which shall not be less than twenty thousand rupees but which may extend to fifty thousand rupees, or with both. Also whoever employs any adolescent or permits any adolescent to work in contravention of the provisions shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than six months but which may extend to two years or with fine which shall not be less than twenty thousand rupees but which may extend to fifty thousand rupees, or with both.</p>
