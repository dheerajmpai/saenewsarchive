Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS)/Short Message Service (SMS) refill booking system has been introduced by OMCs, wherein the customers get SMS on refill booking/generation of cash memo and refill delivery. In case, cash memo is cancelled by the distributor, the reason for the same is captured in the system and SMS of refill cancellation is also triggered to the consumers. In OMCs software, against cancelled refill, LPG cylinder cannot be delivered to any other person. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">OMCs carry out surprise inspections at distributors premises, conduct refill audits, surprise check at customer’s premises, en-route checking of delivery vehicles etc. to prevent the diversion of domestic LPG. Further, whenever complaints are received, the same are investigated and in all established cases, punitive action is taken as per the extant Marketing Discipline Guidelines (MDG) and the Distributorship Agreement. Whenever complaints/information on commercial establishments using domestic cylinders receive, State Government/District Authorities take necessary action.</p>
