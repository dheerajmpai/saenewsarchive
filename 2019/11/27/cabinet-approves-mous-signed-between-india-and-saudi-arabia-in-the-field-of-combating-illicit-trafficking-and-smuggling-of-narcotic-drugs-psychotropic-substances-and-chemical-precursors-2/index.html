<p style="text-align:justify">Background</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Illegal Drug trafficking is a global illicit trade. Massive production and circulation of drugs through various convenient routes especially through Afghanistan is paving ways for high consumption of drugs amongst youth thus creating a negative impact on public health and adding to criminalization of the society.  Drug trafficking has also provided funding for insurgency and terrorism in various regions throughout the world.  Narco-terrorists and international criminal organizations that thrive on the illegal drug trade now threaten the security of many nations. </p>
