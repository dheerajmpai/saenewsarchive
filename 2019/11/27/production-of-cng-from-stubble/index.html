<p style="text-align:justify">Government of India has launched Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) initiative on 1.10.2018 to promote CBG as an alternative, green transport fuel for efficient management of biomass and organic waste. As part of the SATAT scheme, Indian Oil Corporation Limited, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited, Gail (India) Limited and Indraprastha Gas Limited had launched an Expression of Interest (EoI) for procurement of CBG from the entrepreneurs at an assured price. The CBG shall be sold to automobiles as clean fuel in a similar way to CNG and can also be sold to domestic, industrial and commercial consumers which are using LPG and other fuels. SATAT initiative has the potential of addressing environmental problems arising from stubble burning. The viability is based on techno commercial factors.</p>
