<p style="text-align:justify">Agricultural Scientists Recruitment Board (ASRB):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Agricultural Scientists Recruitment Board (ASRB) was initially set up with the approval of the Cabinet at its meeting held on 01.11.1973 as an independent recruiting agency for the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). It was established with the main objective of recruitment to all the scientific positions under the ICAR as the UPSC was reluctant to undertake recruitment to the posts of the ICAR on the ground that it was not a Government organization but a registered Society under the Societies Registration Act 1860.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Now with a view to grant an independent status and functional autonomy to the Board, the Cabinet at its meeting held on 1st August, 2018 has approved the ASRB to be delinked from the ICAR and attached it with the Department of Agricultural Research &#038; Education (DARE) under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare. For purposes of autonomy, secrecy, accountability and efficient functioning, the Cabinet has inter-alia approved that the Board shall have its own cadre of administrative staff in the secretariat and have independent administrative control, by delinking the existing provision of posting of staff from ICAR headquarters. The position of Secretary of the Board has also been upgraded to that of Joint Secretary to the Government of India. </p>
