<p style="text-align:justify">Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought to dispel the notion that India is as reluctant to join the RCEP trade deal.

<p style="text-align:justify">RCEP negotiations which began in Cambodia in 2012 covers areas, including trade in goods and services, investment, market access, economic cooperation, intellectual property and e-commerce.</p>
