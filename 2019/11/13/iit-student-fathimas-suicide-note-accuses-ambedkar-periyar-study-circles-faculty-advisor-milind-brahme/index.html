<p><strong>&#8220;In the case of my death, the whole of blame will be unremittingly upon Mr Hemachandran Karah and Mr Milind Brahme.&#8221; </strong>said the excerpt from her suicide note.</p>



<p>The 19-year-old Fathima had written multiple notes on her mobile phone that details the motive behind her extreme action. The note read &#8220;In case of my death. This should be considered as my last non nuncupative statement. I never realised that I would miss my home so much. I abhor this place. How I yearn for my home, to be suspended in the delicious inertia like an inteminable sleep from which I can never be roused. In the case of my death the whole blame will be unremittingly upon <strong>Hemachandran Karah</strong> and <strong>Mr Milind Brahme</strong> &#8220;</p>



<p>Fathima was a first year Humanities and Social Sciences student. &#8220;Unlike what the institute claims she had performed excellently in her academics&#8221; mentioned a current second here student from Humanities Department of IIT Madras <em>(name withheld)</em>.</p>

<p>Professor Milind Brahme is the faculty advisor of <strong>Ambedkar Periyar Study Circle </strong>an Independent student body IIT Madras. Despite the accusations he continues to be so. <a href="https://hss.iitm.ac.in/team-members/milind-brahme/"> Milind Brahme</a> holds his PhD from<strong> Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi</strong> and teaches Translation Studies / Comparative Studies at IIT Madras.</p>



<p>In an earlier revelation the student had also accused <strong>Sudarshan Padmanabhan</strong>, an associate professor at Department of Humanities and Social Sciences at IIT Madras.</p>



<p>Ambedkar Periyar Study circle is known in spewing hatredness towards minority communities in the Institute. Earlier it had attacked the<a href="http://13.235.0.46/2018/12/16/jain-culture-iit-madras/"> Jain community by supporting compulsory non-vegetarian</a> in all messes at IIT Madras.</p>
