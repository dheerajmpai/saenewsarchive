<p style="text-align:justify"> “All the machines and food products displayed here have been developed in CSIR laboratories especially those in Chandigarh, Mohali, Mysore, Palampur and I have visited these laboratories twice-thrice in the last five years and I have closely seen every product being developed by these machines and have even tasted them myself.” Dr Harsh Vardhanmade the remarks while visiting the Exhibition conducted by CSIR jointly with Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI)and the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“I can guarantee that these products are much more cost-effective, tasty and have better nutritional value without any side-effects, so these products are better compared to other products available in the market in every which way,” added the Union Minister who also holds the portfolio of Health &#038; Family Welfare.</p>
