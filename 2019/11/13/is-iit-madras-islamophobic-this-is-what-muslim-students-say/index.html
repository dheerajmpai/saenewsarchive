<p>Fathima Latheef, a first year student from Humanities Department at IIT Madras was found dead at her hostel at IIT Madras. The suicide note released by their parents <a href="http://13.235.0.46/2019/11/13/iit-student-fathimas-suicide-note-accuses-ambedkar-periyar-study-circles-faculty-advisor-milind-brahme/">accused three </a>professors from the Humanities Department.</p>



<p>Soon after the news broke out <strong>PFI and SFI</strong> claimed that the Islamophobia in IIT Madras was the cause of her death. But this is what Muslim students in IIT say-</p>

<p>Several propaganda websites claimed that the professors were <strong>&#8220;disgusted to see a Muslim name top every test&#8221;</strong>. It turns out this was not the case.</p>



<p>The South Asian Express team reached out to the students of IIT Madras to report the ground situation. A second year student from IIT Madras explained that the accused professor Sudarshan Padbanabhan did not have any history of discriminating students based on religions. In fact, there had been<strong> multiple cases when a Muslim student had topped</strong> in the courses he taught. He has also published <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HT7K7bEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">several journals</a> on Minority welfare and minority issues. </p>



<p>It was also be noted that the academic year of 2019 had started just <strong>4 months ago</strong> and the freshers including Fathima had <strong>not even completed a single semester to obtain the grades.</strong> Which makes the accusations completely baseless. It was also observed IIT Madras has <strong>Islamic Study circles</strong> and <strong>Catholic groups</strong> that conduct event and distribute <strong>fellowship exclusively</strong> for a specific community while there are none when it comes to Hinduism, Jainism or other religions. </p>
