The workshop was attended by representatives from the states, National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and TPs. It aimed at providing handholding support to the states for streamlining the accreditation process on SMART and addressing any other specific query, especially in respect to Employment through Skill Training &#038; Placement (EST&#038;P) component of DAY-NULM. The technical session on SMART portal was conducted by representatives from National Skill Development Corporation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The state representatives were urged to take full benefit of this workshop so that they are able to provide further handholding support to other stakeholders in the statesand emphasised on delivery of quality training programmes on ground and role of TPs in ensuring the same.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In the later part of the day, a dedicated session on e-marketing of high quality products made by Self Help Groups (SHGs) was also undertaken with the states. The session, which was also attended by representatives from various e-commerce portals, was important considering that DAY-NULM envisages facilitating on-boarding of SHG products on e- commerce platforms to provide them access to bigger and emerging markets. The salient features in the proposed MoU with these e-commerce portals were also discussed along with the expected roles of stakeholders involved.</p>
