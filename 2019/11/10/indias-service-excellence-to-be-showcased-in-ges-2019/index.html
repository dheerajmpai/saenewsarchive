<p style="text-align:justify">Government of India through Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), Department of Commerce has been endeavoring to develop exports by incentivizing the service exporters through the Service Exports from India Scheme (SEIS) which is an incentive scheme introduced in the Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 2015-2020. Under SEIS incentives to services exporters during the FY 2018-19 stood at Rs. 4262.80 crore. Rewards under SEIS are provided in the form of Duty Credit Scrips, valid for 24 months from the date of issue, that can be used for payment of basic and additional customs duty on goods imported and the Duty Credit Scrips are freely transferable. Therefore, if the exporter cannot use the Duty Credit Scrip they can be sold in open market. GST rate for transfer/ sale of scrips has been reduced to 0 from 12%.</p>
