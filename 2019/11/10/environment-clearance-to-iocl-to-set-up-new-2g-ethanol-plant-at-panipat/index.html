<p style="text-align:justify">Happy to inform that Environment Clearance is given to IOCL to set up new 2G Ethanol plant in #Panipat. This project not only promotes use of env. friendly fuel but also aids in fulfilment of Govt.’s goal of doubling farmers’ income.@PIB_India @MIB_India @DDNewsLive @moefcc</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">IOCL had earlier submitted a proposal seeking Environmental Clearance for its proposed 100 KLPD Ligno-Cellulosic 2G Ethanol Plant in Baholi, Panipat district of Haryana. The estimated investment in setting up the plant is Rs 766 crore. It is noteworthy to mention that Central Government has identified production and use of ethanol as one the thrust area to reduce import dependency and increase farmers’ income. The Ethanol produced will be used for blending in transportation fuel. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It is also pertinent to highlight that recently the Central Government had declared that no separate environmental clearance is required to produce additional ethanol from B-heavy molasses as it does not contribute to the pollution load, giving further benefits to farmers and the sugar industry.</p>
