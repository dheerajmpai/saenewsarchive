<p>Rajasthan woke up to one of India&#8217;s worst avian catastrophes in late October. Bird carcasses began appearing on the banks of the Sambhar Lake, a 230 square kilometre saltwater body. The numbers surged as the days went by and the lake bank was surrounded by heaps of bird feathers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>29 species were hit, including the Northern Shovelers that had flown in from Europe, and Pallas&#8217;s Gulls, natives of Mongolia and southern Russia.</p>



<p>Mass deaths among migratory birds are not uncommon. Naturalists call such events ‘die-off’. In the US, thousands of blackbirds were found dead on roads on January 1, 2011. In Gujarat, hundreds of migratory seagulls turned up dead in Jamnagar in 2005. However in the case of the Sambhar Lake, it is the high mortality rate that has sparked concern. </p>



<p>Authorities are burying the piling bird carcasses in pits after wrapping them in polythene sheets. This has raised concerns about the risk of contamination of soil, water and salt produced in the area.</p>



<p>Unlike the West, India has no long-term data or eco-toxicological studies. Toxins, pollutants, virus, bacteria and fungus are thought to be the usual suspects in such tragedies.</p>



<p>In the case of Sambhar Lake, suspicion has turned towards the lake itself. Under its plan to rejuvenate six wetlands in Rajasthan, the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change had sought a report on the health of the ecosystems at the Sambhar Lake and five other spots.</p>



<p>Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has ordered that the state wetland authority be made operational. The central government has sent experts from across the country to investigate the avian deaths. On November 20, the Rajasthan High Court took notice of the tragedy and sought a report from amicus curiae Nitin Jain.</p>



<p>Ironically, the deaths have taken place even as successive governments have looked at the Sambhar Lake as a source of revenue. The lake&#8217;s banks are being eyed as potential sites for solar power generation. Saving the lake that hosts migratory birds appears to be low priority, at least for the moment.</p>
