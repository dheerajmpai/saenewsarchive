Improved rail connectivity is likely to further boost the trade &#038; relationship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Railway Projects taken up between India and Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Myanmar are:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">· Bhutan: No rail connectivity project is under construction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">· Myanmar: No rail connectivity project is under construction.     </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">                                                            </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The execution of rail connectivity projects with neighbouring countries depends on various factors such as land acquisition and forest clearance etc. in India. It also entails a large number of works to be done in the associated neighbouring countries.  Hence, no precise time-frame for completion of projects can be indicated.</p>
