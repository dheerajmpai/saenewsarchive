Further, a model for Sikkim was also developed by Regional centre of ICAR-Research Complex for North Eastern Region, Gangtok, Sikkim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Kerala:  The IOFS model comprising of Crops (Turmeric, Coconut, Fodder, Yam, Banana, Tapioca and Vegetable cowpea) + livestock (2 cows) has been developed at Calicut (Kerala). The model could generate net income of Rs 1, 23, 00 lakhs /acre and 89% of the seeds /planting materials and nutrients required within the system.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Meghalaya: One acre IOFS model comprising of crops and cropping systems rice – lentil, rice – pea, maize + soybean &#8211; french bean, vegetables (tomato, cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, brinjal, chilli, spinach, carrot, pumpkin, bitter gourd etc.), fruits (Assam lemon, papaya, peach, guava) and fodder crops, livestock (1 milch cow &#038; 1 calf), fishery in 0.046 ha has been established at Umiam (Meghalaya). Net income of Rs. 73,903/year was recorded. The model could also generate 80% of the seeds /planting materials, nutrients  required within the system.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Sikkim: A 1.25 acre IOFS model comprising of cropping systems (rice – vegetable pea, rice – potato – dhaincha, rice – toria  – dhaincha, rice – cabbage–dhaincha, maize– soybean– buckwheat, coriander– radish– broccoli– fenugreek and cauliflower– pea– beet root– spinach), 2 cows and 50 poultry birds has been developed for Sikkim. Net income of Rs. 1, 37,000/year can be obtained from this model.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Tamil Nadu:  One acre Integrated Organic Farming System (IOFS) model comprising of cropping systems okra+ leaf coriander–maize + cowpea (fodder), green manure- cotton- sorghum, and fodder grasses (CoCN4 and desmanthus)+ agroforestry (Sesbania grandiflora, Thespesia populnea, Lucaena leucocephala)+ dairy (2 cows+vermicompost+ boundry plantations (desmanthus, banana, glyricidia)+ supporting area (manure pit, threshing floor) has been established at Coimbatore (Tamil Nadu).      The IOFS model could generate net return of Rs. 1,68,669/acre. The system generates 84% of the organic inputs such as seeds/planting materials, nutrients and botanical formulations for insect-disease management within the system.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Need based trainings are also given to develop integrated organic farming system models.</p>
