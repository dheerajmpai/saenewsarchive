Definition of commitment is evolving every year and I am trying to figure out problematic structures in our relations with role models in our families. The film &#8220;Commitment&#8221; is about our dilemmas about the sense of identity, difficulty in choosing between either the role of traditional mother or modern mother. I believe cinema is a very personal art and the idea for this film came from my own feelings and life story said, Semih Kaplanoğlu, director of famous Yusuf Trilogy in press conference during IFFI 2019 at Panaji, Goa today</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“We keep searching for our identity as Turkey is at the meeting point of east and west. Writers like Orhan Pamuk are also looking at the question of identity.  Countries like Turkey and India which are in this dilemma of tradition versus modernity have sensitive creative processes.</p>
