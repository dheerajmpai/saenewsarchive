Speaking on the occasion Shri Pokhriyal said that both the countries would deepen their relationship with enhanced cooperation in Higher Education.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He highlighted that the MHRD has initiated several schemes for improving the quality of Higher Education by way of Internationalization of Higher Education viz. Scheme for Promotion of Academic Research &#038; Collaboration (SPARC), GIAN, SII (Short term India centric courses).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Minister also informed that last year HRD Ministry started Scheme for Promotion of Academic Research &#038; Collaboration (SPARC) for improving the research ecosystem through joint research programmes and in a short span of less than one year of the launch of the scheme, 54 joint projects from Australian and Indian institutions have been started. He further informed that ‘Study in India’ programme of MHRD aims to provide quality education to the international student community and to promote Indian education system in international forum. It is an ongoing initiative promoting inward mobility of international students and offers numerous scholarships and fee waivers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He highlighted that in order to showcase the variety of studies available in India, we started short term India-centric courses related to Yoga, Ayurveda, Naturopathy etc. The Minister hoped that there will be enhanced participation from Australia in all these programmes/schemes.

The Council was conceptualized during the Ministerial Meeting held in 2010. Setting up of a bi-national body with representation from academia, policy makers and industry is a useful mechanism to enhance interaction on issues related to education and further collaboration between both countries.</p>
