<p style="text-align:justify">An importer can apply for registration not earlier than 60th day and not later than 15th day before the expected date of arrival of the import consignment. The validity of registration will be for a period of 75 days. The only thing to be entered by an importer in the Bill of Entry is the registration number and expiry date of registration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The purpose of SIMS is to gather advance information on important items of iron and steel and make it available to the stakeholders including Government and Indian domestic industry in responding to the market conditions in a more dynamic manner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This information was given by the Minister of Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.</p>
