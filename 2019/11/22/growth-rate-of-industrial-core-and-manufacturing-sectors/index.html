<p style="text-align:justify">The growth of industrial sector is an interplay of several factors, like domestic demand, demand for exports, level of investment and prevailing prices. The Government has been continuously taking steps to boost industrial growth including infrastructure sector which includes putting in place a policy framework to create conducive business environment, strengthening infrastructure network and ensuring availability of required inputs. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy and procedures have been simplified and liberalised progressively. The Government has also taken up a series of measures to improve Ease of Doing Business.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Recently, several short- term and long-term measures have been taken to boost investment, production and demand. Corporate tax rate has been slashed to 22% for domestic companies and 15% for new domestic manufacturing companies, drive has been initiated for GST refund to MSME within 30 days, ban has been lifted for purchase of new vehicles in ministries/ departments and tax benefits provided to boost demand of vehicles. The Government has made upfront capital release of Rs 70,000 crore to Public Sector Banks and has made additional provision for lending and liquidity of Rs 5 lakh crore to increase credit flow to industries. To bolster consumption/ demand, the banks have cut interest rates, a move that will lead to lower EMI for home, auto and other loans. To strengthen real estate sector, Alternate Investment Fund has been established to provide last mile funding for completion of stalled projects under affordable and middle-income housing category. Reform momentum towards self- certification, labour laws, environment clearance will boost investment and production. </p>
