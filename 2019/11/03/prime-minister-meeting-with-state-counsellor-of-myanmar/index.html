<p style="text-align:justify">Prime Minister emphasized the priority India attaches to Myanmar as a partner at the crossroads of India&#8217;s Look East Policy and the Neighbourhood First policies. Towards this end, he emphasized India&#8217;s continuing commitment to improve physical connectivity to and through Myanmar to Southeast Asia, including through building road, port and other infrastructure. India would also continue to strongly support the expansion of capacity for Myanmar&#8217;s police, military and civil servants, as well as its students and citizens. The leaders agreed that people to people connectivity would help expand the base of the partnership, and therefore welcomed the expansion of air connectivity between the two countries, and the growing interest of India&#8217;s businesses in Myanmar, including the plans of the Government of India to host a business event for the CLMV countries (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam) in Yangon at the end of November 2019.</p>
