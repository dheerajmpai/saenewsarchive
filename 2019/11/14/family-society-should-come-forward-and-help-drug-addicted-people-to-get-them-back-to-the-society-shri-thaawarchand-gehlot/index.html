These people need to be seen as those suffering from a disease. We need to provide appropriate medicine and counseling for those suffering from the diseases of addiction. There is a need also to ensure that these treatments are available to everyone easily and without discrimination. Another important aspect is about stigmatization of these individuals. Even if these people stop their drug use, they continue to be discriminated by the society. Addressing at the inaugural session of “XXI Annual Conference of the International Society of Addiction Medicine (ISAM 2019)” here today, he said that the family and society should come forward and help such individuals to get them back to the society, start working and become productive members of the society. </p>
