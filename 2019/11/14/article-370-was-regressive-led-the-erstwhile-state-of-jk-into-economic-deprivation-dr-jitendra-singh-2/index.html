Terming Article 370 as an “aberration” and calling it a “miscarriage of justice”, he said several path breaking Central Laws including Ban on Child Marriages, anti-dowry legislations, Right To Education, Minimum Wages Act and the Triple Talaq ban were not implemented in the State. Dr. Jitendra Singh was addressing a group of 22 students from Delhi University here today.</p>

There was rampant violation of Human Rights of Girl Child as Child Marriages were not banned in the state, besides polygamy was also prevalent. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">With the abrogation of the two Articles, Dr. Jitendra Singh said the two Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakhare on the path to rapid development. He said the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has sanctioned two AIIMS for the UT of J&#038;K, &#8211; the only state or UT in the country with two AIIMS. Besides, nine medical colleges and an IIT and IIM are being set up in the J&#038;K UT.
