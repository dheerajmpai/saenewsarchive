<p style="text-align:justify">This leased line connectivity has been done within a record time of 15 days which includes Radio Connectivity in Backbone/Aggregation from Amritsar to Dera Baba Nanak, a distance of 45 KM, and Last mile underground OFC connectivity of 5 KM from Dera Baba Nanak station to ICP/Dera Baba Nanak. This was a very challenging project for RailTel as the time period given was very short and due to bad weather the work was hampered for couple of days. RailTel had to erect two 30-meter-tall towers for Radio link to provide seamless connectivity as Dera Baba Nanak is at a distance of 49 km for which repeater had to be provided for connectivity to the farthest / remotest point in Punjab near International Border. </p>
