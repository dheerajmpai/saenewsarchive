<ul><li>The Family <strong>doesn’t claim that Fathima had to face discrimination because of her Muslim identity.</strong> Instead, they have a<strong> ‘DOUBT’ that Islamophobia</strong> could have played a part in the issue.

It is rather the family’s doubt that her Muslim Identity could have played a role. </li><li>Fathima’s father has clarified that she didn’t use to wear a Shawl<strong> even before coming to the campus.</strong> It’s not a case of Fathima giving up or finding it difficult to wear a Shawl after coming to the campus.</li></ul>
