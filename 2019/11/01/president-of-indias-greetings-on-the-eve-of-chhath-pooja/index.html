<p style="text-align:justify">“On the auspicious occasion of Chhath Pooja, I convey greetings and best wishes to all my fellow citizens in India and abroad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Chhath Pooja is a unique festival in which devotees worship sun, rivers, water bodies and extol the virtues of the nature. It begins with rigorous fast and ends with a sacred bath, a ritual which is undertaken by devotees on the belief that it purifies their soul.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Let this Chhath Pooja be an occasion to express our devotion to Sun God, Mother Earth and rivers. May this festival bring happiness to everyone’s life and inspire us to respect the nature more”.</p>
