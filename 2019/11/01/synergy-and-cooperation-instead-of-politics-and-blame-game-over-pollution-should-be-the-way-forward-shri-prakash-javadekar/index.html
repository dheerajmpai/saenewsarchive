<p style="text-align:justify">The Electric-vehicles are supplied by Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), a joint venture of state-owned NTPC Limited, Power Finance Corporation, Rural Electrification Corporation and POWERGRID, under the Government of India.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">With this partnership, the Government of India continues to be an active participant in India&#8217;s quest for reduced emissions &#038; vehicular electrification. Speaking on the occasion, Shri Javadekar stated the benefits of using e-vehicles, “E-cars are an attractive, sustainable and profitable solution to mitigate climate change and the risk of public health caused by vehicular emission.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Elaborating about the conscious efforts being made by the Government of Indiain enabling e-mobility in the country, the Minister said “The Government is promoting e-mobility by taking a lead in changing the fleet of the existing petrol and diesel cars used for official purposes with electric cars. The current 5 lakh vehicles that are used by the government and its agencies across the country will be replaced by e-vehicles in a phased manner”.  It is expected that the positive outcome of replacing existing petrol and diesel cars by e-vehicles will be:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">•           Fuel savings of litres per annum (in million)             : 832</p>
