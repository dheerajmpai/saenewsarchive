<p style="text-align:justify">The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) today signed two major agreements, referred to as Joint Declaration of Intent (JDoI), along with Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (hereinafter referred to as &#8220;BMZ&#8221;), Germany. One DoI was with the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (hereinafter referred to as &#8220;BMBF&#8221;) for Cooperation in the Field of Skill Development and Vocational Education and Training. The second was signed for Dual VET initiative marking Sustainable Growth of Skills with Siemens Limited, India.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The intended cooperation agreements will give special emphasis to enhancing the quality of trainees thus enabling them to gain and apply further technology skills and subsequently help them to find employment in innovative, sustainable sectors and technologies such as renewable energy, e-mobility and energy-efficiency.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The agreements are a significant step in the direction of creating a conducive framework for skill development and vocational education and training for inclusive and sustainable growth. In line with their understanding that the availability of demand-oriented skilled workers is crucial for India’s future, all entities will work togetherfor high-quality training in order to create opportunities for young people and foster public and private enterprises alike. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The signing ceremonies were graced by Mr. Nobert Barthale, Parliamentary State Secretary(PSts), BIZ and Ms. Anja Karliczek, Federal Minister of Education and Research representing Germany.Some of the other key dignitaries present on the occasion were Ms. Cornelia Groehl, Personal Secretary(PSts), Mr. Philipp Knill, Dy Head of Asia Department, BMZ, Ms. Tanja Bauer, Senior Policy Officer, Ms. Christiane Hieronymus, Minister &#038; Head of Economic Cooperation and Development, German Embassy, Ms. Susane Burger, Director General, European and International Cooperation in Education, Dr. Volkmar Dietz, Deputy Director General, Large Facilities and Basic Research, German Federal Ministry of Education and Research.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The association will provide a systematic structure for conducting mutual consultations, advisory work and policy exchanges at ministerial and expert levels and provide technical assistance. This collaboration will help further develop the successful cooperation in the various fields covered by the Indo-German Joint Working Group on Vocational Education and Training established under the said MoU. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It will support India’s endeavour to establish an innovative system to comprise the cooperation of the public and the private sector, independent structures for quality assurance, examination and certification as well as formulation of national standards and a comprehensive policy. The quality of vocational training will be raised by means of these measures and by building adequate capacities within companies, training institutes and establishing models for local governance structures, enabling cooperative skill development and vocational training.  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Sharing his thoughts on joining hands with the Federal Republic of Germany, Dr. Mahendra Nath Pandey, Union Minister for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship said, “Germany has been one of countries which is on top of the manufacturing and innovation pyramid and continues to develop most high-end products. It has some of the best working models in sustainable workforce development which is the reason for the country’s economic progress. This partnership with Germany will help strengthen our skill development initiatives.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Under the second MoU signing, joint efforts in particular shall address the IGVET cluster approach that has proven successful and the Dual VET initiative of Siemens in partnership with other corporates at Government ITIs. Further, the efforts shall address the qualification of vocational training personnel and the introduction of elements of Dual Training inspired by the German model with the involvement of the private sector, especially micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSME). </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Based on discussions in the Indo-German Joint Working Group on Vocational Education and Training and on bilateral consultations, the following fields of cooperation have been identified:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">To help achieve these goals, the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH intends to implement its ‘develoPPP’ programme on behalf of the BMZ. As part of this programme, GIZ and Siemens will sign a cooperation agreement for the implementation of a joint project called ‘Skills for Sustainable Growth’ with support from MSDE. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In order to be scalable, the project shall be open to include further German and Indian partners. The aim of the project is to implement elements of the German Dual Vocational Education and Training (VET) methodology in key trades in a significant amount of Government Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) across the country to make the trainees highly efficient and completely industry-ready.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The partners to the cooperation agreement, with support from MSDE and the participating State Directorates responsible for the ITIs, will ensure the effective implementation of the project in order to meet its objectives and serve as a model for the remaining ITIs in the country. Siemens and GIZ plan to focus on the pedagogical development at ITIs while engaging the local private sector, especially MSME, for industry training. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The project will leverage the outreach made in the cluster approach towards MSMEs. MSDE through DGT, BMZ through GIZ and Siemens shall establish a Joint working group with all stakeholders to develop an interactive mechanism between industry and ITIs with coordination in different geographical areas in the field of implementation of Dual VET initiatives through applicable models envisaged to be implemented over four years.</p>
