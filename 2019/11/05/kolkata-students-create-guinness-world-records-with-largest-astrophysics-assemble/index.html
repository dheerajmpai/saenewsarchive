<p style="text-align:justify">Astronomers use spectroscopes to know details like temperature, chemical composition, etc. of celestial objects hundreds or millions of light years away from us. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">A small personal model of advanced spectroscopes can easily be made by anyone using a box made of cardboard that has a very narrow window used to channel light into the spectroscope. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">A piece of a Compact Disc is used to split the light by a process called diffraction. This attempt is dedicated to Meghnad Saha and C. V. Raman.</p>
