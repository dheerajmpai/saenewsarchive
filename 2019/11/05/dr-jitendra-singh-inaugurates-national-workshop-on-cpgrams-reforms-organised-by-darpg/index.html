<p style="text-align:justify">Speaking on the occasion, Dr Jitendra Singh said that Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has adopted the mantra of ‘Maximum Governance, Minimum Government’, since the very beginning. He said that this approach is closely associated with citizen participation and citizen centricity, which leads to citizen satisfaction. The Minister added that the Government has taken many ‘out of box’ decisions, which were to benefit the last man in the queue. He quoted the examples of self-attestation, doing away with the interviews at lower posts. These steps required strong will and determination, he said. The Minister also mentioned about many initiatives that have been taken by the DARPG during the last five years. He said that the format of PM Excellence Awards has been changed substantially, which has encouraged almost all district collectors to participate in it. Quoting other initiatives, the Minister said that the practice of posting young IAS officers as Assistant Secretaries in the Central Ministries and Departments for the initial 3 months of their service has been started by the Government. He spoke about other initiatives such as Shillong Declaration and regional conferences on good governance conducted by the department in various parts of the country. Dr Jitendra Singh said that the number of grievances lodged with the Government have increased 8 fold, from about 2 lakh in the beginning of the Government to about 16 lakh at present, which depicts the pro- activeness, sincerity and timely response of the Department. He also mentioned about the RTI portal from where the RTIs can be filed anytime from anywhere. He added that the states need to be more pro-active in handing Public Grievances. The Minister further emphasised that awareness needs to be created among the public about the grievance disposal mechanism.
