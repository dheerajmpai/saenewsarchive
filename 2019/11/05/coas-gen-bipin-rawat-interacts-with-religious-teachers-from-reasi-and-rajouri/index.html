The religious teachers represent the major religions in the valley and included 15 Maulvis, four Pandits and two Granthis. This capacity building tour, the first of its kind, showcases the secularism and unity of the Kashmiris working towards development of the region. General Rawat exhorted the teachers to work towards maintaining peace in the region and promised full support to them towards fulfilling their local requirements. Indian Army’s stand reflects the core values of the nation and this initiative is guided by this idea.</p>
