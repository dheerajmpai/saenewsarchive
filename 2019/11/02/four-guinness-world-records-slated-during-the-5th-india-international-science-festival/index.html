<p style="text-align:justify">On the opening day of the four-day mega event, the largest astrophysics lesson and assembly of spectroscopes will be attempted with the participation of over 1,750 students.  Astronomers use spectroscopes to know details like temperature, chemical composition, etc. of celestial objects hundreds or millions of light years away from us. A small personal model of advanced spectroscopes can easily be made by anyone using a box made of cardboard that has a very narrow window used to channel light into the spectroscope. A piece of a Compact Disc is used to split the light by a process called diffraction. This attempt is dedicated to renowned scientists Meghnad Saha and C. V. Raman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The largest electronics lesson and assembly of optical media communication units at a single location will be attempted the next day with the participation of over 950 students.  Communication link set up through Infrared signals &#8211; Wireless infrared communications refers to the use of free-space propagation of light waves in the near infrared band as a transmission medium for communication. This attempt is dedicated to Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman and Satyendra Nath Bose.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The record attempt for most people assembling Radio kits simultaneously will be attempted on November 7, 2019 with the participation of over 400 students. Like all other electromagnetic waves, radio waves travel at the speed of light in vacuum. They are generated by electric charges undergoing acceleration, such as time varying electric currents. Radio waves are generated artificially by transmitters and received by radio receivers, using antennas. This attempt is dedicated to Jagadish Chandra Bose.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The largest human image of a human chromosome will be attempted to be formed on the final day, November 8, 2019 with the participation of over 400 students. In the nucleus of each cell, the DNA molecule is packaged into thread-like structures called chromosomes. Each chromosome is made up of DNA tightly coiled many times around proteins called histones that support its structure. The attempt is designed to inculcate the spirit of discovery in young minds to start their own exploration in the world of Science and Technology.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The host city of the 5th IISF-2019 is home to renowned scientific institutions that have been the workplace of pioneering scientists who gave shape to science in India. IISF is the largest science festival in the world. The theme for this year’s festival is RISEN India –Research, Innovation and Science Empowering the Nation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The IISF 2019 is the fifth edition since its inception in 2015. The first and second IISF were held in New Delhi, the third in Chennai and the fourth IISF was held in Lucknow, which witnessed a widespread footfall from over 10 lakh people including foreign delegates.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">IISF, organized jointly by Science &#038; Technology -related Ministries and Departments of the Government of India and Vijnana Bharati (Vibha), is an annual festival to celebrate the achievements of India’s scientific and technological advancements with students, innovators, craftsmen, farmers, scientists and technocrats from India and abroad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">IISF-2019 expects to host a gathering of approximately 12,000 participants from India and abroad. Multitude of significant events are lined up for IISF 2019, which will host more than 28 different events during this period.</p>
