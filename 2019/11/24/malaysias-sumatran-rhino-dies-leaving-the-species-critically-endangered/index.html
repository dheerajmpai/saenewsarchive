<p>With the death of the 25 year old female rhino named Iman on Saturday on the island of Borneo, the Sumatran rhino is now officially extinct in Malaysia.</p>



<p>The rhino had cancer. Malaysia’s last male Sumatran rhino died in May this year leaving the species critically endangered.</p>



<p>The Sumatran rhino once roamed across Asia, but has now almost disappeared from the wild, with fewer than 100 animals believe to exist with estimates as low as 30.</p>



<p>They species have been hard hit by poaching and habitat loss. But the biggest threat they are facing is the fragmented nature of their populations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Sumatran rhino is the smallest living rhino species and one of the five rhino species that can be found today, closely related to the woolly rhinoceros which became extinct about 10,000 years ago.</p>
