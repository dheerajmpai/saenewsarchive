<p>As part of the &#8216;Make in India&#8217; initiative, Flipkart will be facilitating the manufacturing and distribution of Nokia branded Smart TVs and will also manage end-to-end sales in order to create thousands of new jobs, the e-commerce platform said in a statement.</p>



<p>Flipkart has announced this strategic partnership with Nokia which will mark Nokia&#8217;s entry into the television segment in India, a category that has become quite competitive in the country following the launch of Mi TVs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Nokia branded Smart TVs will feature sound system from JBL as the company promises superior audio quality. This will also mark JBL by Harman&#8217;s debut in the television sector in India. Flipkart says that poor sound quality has been a major pain point for consumers purchasing television, and the company looks to solve that with the Nokia branded Smart TVs.</p>



<p>The announcement from Flipkart does not reveal when the Nokia branded Smart TVs will be launched on the e-commerce platform. There is also no word yet on what these Smart TVs will look like or their expected cost in India.</p>
