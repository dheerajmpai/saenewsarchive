<p style="text-align:justify">Implementation Strategy and Targets:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">After Cabinet approval, necessary formalities for bringing the Protocol into force will be completed. Implementation would be watched and reported by the Ministry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Major impact:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Through updation of the Double Taxation Avoidance Convention’s (DTAC&#8217;s) provisions to international standards, the Amending Protocol between India and the Federative Republic of Brazil will facilitate elimination of double taxation. Clear allocation of taxing rights between Contracting States through DTAC will provide tax certainty to investors &#038; businesses of both countries. The Amending Protocol will augment the flow of investment through lowering of tax rates in source State on interest, royalties and fees for technical services. The Amending Protocol implements minimum standards and other recommendations of G-20 OECD Base Erosion Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project. Inclusion of Preamble Text, a Principal Purpose Test, a general anti abuse provision in the DTAC along with a Simplified Limitation of Benefits Clause as per BEPS Project will result in curbing of tax planning strategies which exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules</p>
