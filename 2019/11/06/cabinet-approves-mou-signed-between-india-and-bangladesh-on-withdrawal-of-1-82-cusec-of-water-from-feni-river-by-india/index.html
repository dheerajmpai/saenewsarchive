<p style="text-align:justify">Benefits:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">          As on date, there is no water sharing agreement on Feni river between India and Bangladesh.  The present supply of drinking water to Sabroom town is inadequate. The ground water in this region has high iron content.  Implementation of this scheme would benefit over 7000 population of Sabroom town .</p>
