<p style="text-align:justify">First timer at the festival, actress Taapsee Pannu said that she was surprised to know such films were made. “I’ve not seen films that use audio to explain the scenes; so I wanted to surely see how it’s done,” she said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“I don’t like to use the term ‘visually impaired’, in fact, ‘your other senses are stronger than ours. I’m happy such movies can reach out to you,” Ms. Taapsee Pannu added. In future she hoped that her films are converted into audio films as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The movies that will be screened are ‘Lage Raho Munnabhai’, ‘M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story’ and the Konkani film ‘Questao De Confusao’ with additional narration for the visually impaired.</p>
