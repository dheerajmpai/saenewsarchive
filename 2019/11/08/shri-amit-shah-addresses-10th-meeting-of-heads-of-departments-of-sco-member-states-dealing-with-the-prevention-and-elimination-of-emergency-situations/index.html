<p style="text-align:justify">Stressing on the fact that India attaches special importance to SCO as a platform for regional outreach, Shri Shah informed that India has participated in more than 20 ministerial meetings in the last 2 years. He said that India has always been the first respondent in situations of Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Management in Indian subcontinent region. He also stressed on the need for all stakeholders to focus on building disaster resilient infrastructure to minimize the loss of precious lives and property. Taking initiative in this direction, in September 2019, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi launched the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) at UN Climate Action Summit 2019 in New York, Shri Shah said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Expressing pride in organizing an SCO Ministerial Meeting for the first time in India, the Home Minister expressed hope that this meeting would bring together all SCO Nations to deliberate on an effective strategy to build disaster resilient infrastructure and bolster each others’ capabilities to efficiently tackle future disasters by exchanging best practices. This forum would become an important platform to increase mutual cooperation among SCO Nations in disaster management, he added.</p>
