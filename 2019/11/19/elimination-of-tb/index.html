The National Strategic Plan 2017-25 for ending TB by 2025 was developed in 2017 and included various interventions through multi-stakeholder engagement to reduce the burden of TB. These interventions are being implemented from 2017 onwards and the impact of these would be evident in the subsequent years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Globally, the average rate of decline in the TB incidence rate was 1.8% between 2016 and 2017. In India, rate of decline in TB incidence rate was 3.3% between 2016 and 2017 as compared to 2.3% between 2015 and 2016. TB incidence further reduced by 2.5% between 2017 and 2018. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">There are various types of TB tests. When a skin test is positive, it is not always a cause of worry, as the person might only have infection and not have the disease. When a sputum microscopy or molecular test is positive, a diagnosis of TB is confirmed and although a cause for concern, the patient should be promptly started on Anti-TB treatment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It is true that Government is focusing on identifying additional cases among family contacts of people whose sputum samples have tested positive and preventive treatment is offered to those eligible below 6 years of age. In the year 2018, 83109 children <6 years of age were initiated on TB preventive therapy.</p>
