<p>Lumbini, the birthplace of Lord Buddha echoed the verses of the Tripitaka, the traditional scriptures for the Buddhists as thousands of Buddhist pilgrims from 25 countries including India, Thailand, Myanmar and Nepal chanted for three days to mark the 2nd episode of Tripitaka Chanting Ceremony. </p>



<p>The three-day event began with chanting from Sutrapitak, followed by verses from Tripitaka chanted by participants in their own language and style. The second day of the ceremony witnessed the chanting of Abidhamapitak, led by monks from Myanmar, and followed by monks from Nepal, Japan, Vietnam, China and others. On the third day, the monks from Thailand and Cambodia chanted Binaypitak which concluded with the lighting of candles in the holy garden of Maya Devi Temple</p>



<p>The first session of the chanting ceremony was held in 2018 in which about 700 monks and nuns participated from 18 countries.</p>



<p>The Tripitaka, holds high significance in Buddhism, it is an elite text and is lesser-known among people. The organisers claim that such events would help in making people aware of the scriptures as well as give them spiritual stimulation and motivate them to live with peace and tranquility.</p>
