Under this scheme, Maximum Admissible Export Quantity (MAEQ) of 60 LMT has been fixed among sugar mills for export during the current sugar season 2019-20. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Government has approved a Scheme for export of sugar by providing a lumsum export subsidy at the rate of Rs.10,448/- per MT towards expenses on marketing costs including handling, upgrading and other processing costs and costs of international and internal transport and freight charges on export of sugar.  The total expenditure in this regard would be about Rs.6268 crore.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In order to ensure that the assistance is directly credited into the accounts of farmers, the sugar mill shall open a separate no-lien account in a nationalized bank/cooperative bank and furnish to that bank the list of farmers along with bank accounts details and extent of cane price dues payable to the farmers for the sugar season 2019-20 and cane price arrears of previous sugar seasons, duly certified by the Cane Commissioner or Director of Sugar of the state concerned.  The bank shall credit the amount of assistance to the farmers’ accounts on behalf of the mills against cane dues payable and subsequent balance, if any, shall be credited into mill’s account.   </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">To encourage sugar industry to start exploring possibility of export of sugar, the customs duty on export of sugar has been withdrawn w.e.f. 20th March, 2018.</p>
