It is an annual publication brought out by the Transport Research Wing of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways which reports on accidents, related deaths and injuries, calendar year-wise, based on information supplied by the Police Departments of States and UTs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The major findings of the Report are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">(vii) The share of males in number of total accident deaths was 86% while the share of </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">        females hovered around 14% in 2018.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">(viii) Road accidents are multi-causal and are often the result of an interplay of various   </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">factors. Like (i) human error, (ii) road environment and (iii) vehicular condition. The information received from the States/UTs on the causes of road accidents brings out inter-alia the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Road traffic accidents are amenable to remedial actions  and the Ministry has been  implementing  a  multi pronged  road safety strategy based on Education, Engineering (both of roads and vehicles), Enforcement and Emergency Care consisting inter-alia of  setting up Driver training schools, creating awareness, strengthening automobile safety standards ,improving road infrastructure ,  carrying out road safety audit  etc. High priority has been accorded to rectification of black spots. These efforts of the Ministry are manifest in the decline in the CAGR of accidents and accident related deaths during the period 2010-18.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">A major initiative of the Ministry this year in the field of Road Safety has been the passing of the Motor Vehicle Amendment Bill 2019 which focuses on  road safety measures which  include, inter-alia, stiff hike in penalties for traffic violations and electronic monitoring of the same, enhanced penalties for juvenile driving, cashless treatment during the golden hour, computerisation/automation of vehicle fitness and driving tests, recall of defective vehicles,  extending the scope of third party liability and payment of increased compensation for hit and run cases. This act, it is hoped, will bring in greater discipline and responsible attitude amongst road users and will mark a turning point in road accidents and related deaths to which the country remains seriously committed.</p>
