ICAR under “Network project on soil biodiversity- bio fertilizers” has developed improved and efficient strains of biofertilizers specific to different crops and soil types. ICAR study indicates that biofertilizers can improve crop yields by 10-25% and supplement costly chemical fertilizer (N, P) by nearly 20-25% in most of the cases when used along with the chemical fertilizers. Bihar Agriculture University, Bihar and KVKs including KVK Gopalganj are engaged in study on the impact of usage of bio-fertilizers.</p>
