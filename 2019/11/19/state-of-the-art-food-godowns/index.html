Against this, as on 30.09.2019, steel silos of 7.25 LMT capacity have been created. The State-wise details of the number of silos sanctioned (work awarded) and constructed as on 30.09.2019 are at Annexure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The silo developers for construction are selected through tender process. Subsequently, in the Concession Agreement signed between the Authority (i.e. Food Corporation of India/State Government Agencies) and the Concessionaire (developer), timelines are specified for completion of construction of steel silos and non-adherence to these timelines leads to imposition of penalty on the concessionaire. Therefore, this process of construction of steel silos has an in-built feature of specified timelines to complete the construction of steel silos.</p>
