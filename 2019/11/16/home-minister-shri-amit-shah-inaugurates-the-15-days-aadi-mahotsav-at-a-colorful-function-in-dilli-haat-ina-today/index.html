If urban people start using tribal products, they will be able to avoid several physical ailments. Adivasi way of life is guided by primal truths, eternal values and a natural simplicity, the Minister explained. The greatness of the tribes lies in this that they have managed to retain the primal skills and the natural simplicity. Their creations issue from the depths of time.
