<p style="text-align:justify">Approx. 32000 to 37000 ex-servicemen are seeking employment through Army Welfare Placement Organisation (AWPO) per year.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">From the data maintained by DGR where it is seen that the representation of ESM in Group ‘C’ and ‘D’ posts in respect of user organisation is not at par with the reservation prescribed, the user organisation is advised to examine the issue of deficiency and take remedial measures to make up such deficiencies.  The user organisations are also advised to consider undertaking special drive for recruitment of ESM against direct recruitment vacancy reserved for them.</p>
