<p>In a bid to counter the rising drug menace in Assam, parents have started calling up the drug peddlers under the false pretext of buying drugs and then hand them over to the police after nabbing them.Â </p>



<p>Using the same modus operandi, they caught a youth on Sunday and handed him over to the police.</p>



<p>The police detained the youth identified as Zubair Ahmed (22), a resident of a nearby village and seized 5.7 grams of suspected psychotropic substance from his possession, said DSP Pratap Das.</p>



<p>The accused was reportedly caught by the public first, and then handed over to the police. An investigation has been initiated.</p>
