According to these modalities, only those proposals which have been recommended and justified by the concerned State Government/ Union Territory Administration and concurred with by the Registrar General of India (RGI) and the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes are to be considered for amendment of legislation. All actions are taken with respect to proposals of State/UT Governments for the communities demanding Scheduled Tribes status as per the modalities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">These modalities are being followed for inclusion/exclusion of communities under ST list.</p>
