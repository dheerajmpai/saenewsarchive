<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Indian Institute of Skills (IISs) was conceptualized to address above mentioned issues and to develop state of art skill institutions. The vision behind setting up IIS is to build world-class skill training centres by learning from and imbibing best practices from internationally renowned existing skill institutions. IISs are envisaged to have the unique features that would make them different from the existing setup of Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs), Polytechnics, Advanced Training Institutes (ATIs) (which are now known as National Skill Training Institutes).</p>

This Ministry has requested the Government of Gujarat for locating/ identifying the landfor setting up of IIS at Ahmedabad.</p>
