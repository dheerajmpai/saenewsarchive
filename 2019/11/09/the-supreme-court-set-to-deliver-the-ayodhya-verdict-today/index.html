<p>The Supreme Court is set to deliver the judgement regarding the Ayodhya dispute today.</p>



<p>The bench comprises of 5 judges of the Supreme Court, CJI Ranjan Gogoi, Justice S A Bobde, Justice D Y Chandrachud, Justice S Abdul Nazeer and Justice Ashok Bhushan.</p>



<p>Title suit has been broken down into 14 petitions.&nbsp;This is the oldest running land dispute case in the country. The dispute is entered on a plot of land in the city of Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The issue revolves around the control of the site with three parties namely Bhagwan Ram Lalla Virajman, Nirmohi Akhara and the UP Sunni Wakf Board.</p>



<p>Ram Lalla is led by the Hindu Mahasabha representing the diety- baby Ram, whose statue was placed inside the temple.</p>



<p>Nirmohi Akhara, an order of Hindu ascetics who calling to be in possession of the disputed site as its shebait or manager since time immemorial and demand the construction of the Ram temple at the disputed site.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sunni Waqf board, which controls all the waqf properties throughout the country, wants a mosque to be built on the site. In 1945, a Faizabad judge held that the Babri Masjid is a Sunni property.</p>



<p>The bench had granted three days to contesting petitioners to file written notes, narrowing down the issues on which the court is required to adjudicate on 16 October.</p>

<p>Many parts of the country have been advised order especially on digital media and citizens are warned not to send any messages with respect to the verdict.&nbsp;</p>
