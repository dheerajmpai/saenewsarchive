<p>The Verdict for the Ayodhya dispute has been unanimously decided and the members of the Hindu faith have been granted the site. The Central Government will hold rights over the land after which they will create a Trust and then transfer the property to the said Trust within 3 months.</p>



<p>The Supreme Court mentioned that the petitioner Nirmohi Akhada among others will also be a part of the Trust.</p>



<p>The Sunni Wakf board will be granted 5 acres of land at a prominent site in Ayodhya and is at liberty to construct a mosque.</p>



<p>The rightful claim has been ruled in favour of the Ram Temple.</p>



<p>Judges ruled with the input from the Archaeological Survey of India that the Babri Masjid was not constructed on vacant land. That there was a structure underlying the disputed structure.</p>



<p>They also ruled that the destruction of mosque was against rule of law which was filed under a separate petition.</p>



<p>ASI refrained from recording a finding on whether the mosque was built after demolishing a Hindu temple, Supreme Court observes.</p>



<p>The bench also claimed “Every judge of this court has the task to uphold Constitution, cannot differentiate between one religion and another.”</p>
