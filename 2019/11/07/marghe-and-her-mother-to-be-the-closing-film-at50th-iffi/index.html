The India Premiere of “Marghe and Her Mother” directed by Iranian filmmaker, Mohsen Makhmalbaf will be the Closing Film of the festival.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The film revolves around Marghe, a six year old girl who lives with her single mother Claudia who has been kicked out of her house because of payment difficulties, leaving Marghe to an old woman next door. This is Makhmalbaf’s first film set in Italy and in Italian language, away from his regular backdrop of Iran.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The film has already garnered critical acclaim with layered symbolism and a certain innocence in its narrative flow which reflects the master filmmaker’s maturity over the years. The film has certain neo-realist and nouvelle vague influences and calls for the audience’s attention as he pays subtle tribute to two greatest film movements of the world. The film is a remarkable shift from his previous works which focussed on issues of authoritarianism and revolution and the daily lives of Middle East and instead focuses on the issues of identity, social systems, moralities and other aspects of the modern younger generation. The film premiered and was nominated in the Bosphorus Film Festival in 2019.</p>
