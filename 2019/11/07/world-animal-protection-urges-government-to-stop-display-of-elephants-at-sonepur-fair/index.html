<p>World Animal Protection an international animal welfare charity, has written to Prakash Javadekar, the Environment Minister of India and&nbsp; Nitish Kumar, the Chief Minister of Bihar seeking urgent intervention in stopping the proposed display of elephants at Sonepur Fair in Patna, Bihar.</p>



<p>The elephants are displayed for sale at the famous Sonepur fair. In the last few years however, the arrival of elephants at the fair had become almost negligible after a ban on their sale was imposed in 2000. However the demand for an intervention comes following a report in the New Indian Express dated 6th November 2019, Stating ‘Panel formed to ensure jumbos turn up at Bihar’s famous Sonepur fair’.</p>



<p>Many traders regularly misuse the exemption to elephants given under Section 40 to trade in these animals in Sonepur under the guise of gifting. The charity has been running a campaign to end the exemption accorded to elephants in Section 40 of the Wildlife Protection Act. The petition has garnered support from 30,000 people till date.</p>
