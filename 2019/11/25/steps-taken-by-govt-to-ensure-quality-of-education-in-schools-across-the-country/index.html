<p style="text-align:justify">Samagra Shiksha focuses on improvement in quality of education by providing support for different interventions like in-service training of teachers and school heads, conduct of achievement surveys at state and national level, composite school grant to every school for providing a conducive learning environment, grants for library, sports and physical activities, support for Rashtriya Avishkar Abhiyan, ICT and digital initiatives, School Leadership development programme, remedial teaching for academically weaker students, support for Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has been advised to take appropriate steps to review the National Curriculum Framework-2005. The Draft National Education Policy 2019 is presently under consideration. The revision of Curriculum, Syllabi and Textbooks for school education would depend on the finalization and approval of the New Education Policy.</p>
