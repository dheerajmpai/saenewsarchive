It was suggested by the committee to frame a timeline and to draw a transition plan when all new sanctions under RIHS will be stopped and housing subsidy will be drawn from PMAY. Accordingly all Welfare Commissioners were directed to send all the pending applications to the concerned Blocks/ULBs for sanction under PMAY (Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna). No new applications are being accepted under RIHS, 2016 anymore.</p>
