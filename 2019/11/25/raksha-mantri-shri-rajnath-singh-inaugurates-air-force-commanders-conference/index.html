<p style="text-align:justify">Raksha Mantri addressed the Commanders and said “The Nation isproud of the Indian Air Force.  I praise the IAF for its professionalism and laud all air warriors and their families for giving us a most competent and combat worthy force.  The IAF has proven itself time and again. It has earned the respect of foreign Air Forces who are eager to cooperate as well as exercise with us.  We are strengthening our defence capability through increased domestic production and reduced dependence on import of military hardware. We have to seize new opportunities for indigenous design and development and I appreciate the IAF’s effort in this regard. I urge the Air Force Commanders to use the Conference for developing strategies against future challenges and enhancing IAF’s capability.  The IAF is growing steadily towards becoming a truly strategic aerospace power”. The CAS briefed the Raksha Mantri on the current status of the IAF.</p>
