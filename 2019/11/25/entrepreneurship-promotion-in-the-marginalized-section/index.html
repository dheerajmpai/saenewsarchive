During review of the PM YUVA project, the progress under the scheme was not found satisfactory and accordingly, it was decided to restructure the project and implement it through the Institutes in the Skill Ecosystem of the Ministry i.e. Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendras (PMKKs), Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs), Polytechnics, Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS) and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) Training Centres. The pilot project on PM YUVA with the revised strategy is under implementation.</p>

Under the scheme, there is special provision of 12 awards in sub-category under Enterprises Track exclusively for Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe, Women Entrepreneur, Entrepreneur from Persons with Disability (PwDs) and Entrepreneur from Difficult Areas.</p>
