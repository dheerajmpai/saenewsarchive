Venkaiah Naidu has condoled the demise of former Chief Election Commissioner Shri T.N. Seshan &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“It’s with great regret that I come to terms with the demise of Shri Tirunellai Narayana Seshan, an indefatigable crusader for voters’ rights who is credited with initiating wide-ranging electoral reforms to strengthen the foundations of Indian Parliamentary system.  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As the Chief Election Commissioner from 1990-96, he was one of India’s foremost institution builders and turned the Model Code of Conduct into a powerful instrument. He had introduced transparency into the system and imposed spending limits for electoral campaigns of candidates.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">His tenure was marked by many positive changes and helped in providing a level-playing field to all political parties and made the conduct of elections freer and fairer. The Indian Election Commission became a role model for democracies across the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">By putting in place strict policies and processes, Mr Seshan strove hard to eliminate electoral malpractices, while strengthening the autonomy of institutions and enforcing the powers vested in officers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He has left behind a great legacy and it is the duty of everyone who cherishes a strong democracy to uphold and further strengthen it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">With a heavy heart, I convey my profound condolences to the bereaved family members.”, the Vice President said.</p>
