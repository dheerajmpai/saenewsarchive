<p style="text-align:justify">Recalling the constraints faced in producing his debut movie, Mehmet said that the most difficult part was to get financial support for the movie. “ It was also hard to find actors of Turkish origin in Germany as most of the Turkish actors were working in television.

Idea behind the film is creating a dialogue so that some measurable actions are taken to mitigate the problem,” he said. </p>

He also recalled personal experiences about how climate change is affecting relationships between people. </p>
