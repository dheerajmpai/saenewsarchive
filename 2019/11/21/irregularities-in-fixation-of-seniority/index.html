<p style="text-align:justify">Whenever complaints regarding fixation of seniority are received, these references are forwarded to the respective Cadre Controlling Authorities with whom the details of the cases are available, for taking appropriate action. Details regarding action taken by the Cadre Controlling Authorities on such references are, however, not maintained centrally. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Wherever clarifications/ interpretation of Rules/Instructions are sought by the Cadre Controlling Authorities, DoP&#038;T renders its advice in respect of such references.</p>
