It can increase morbidity and mortality by reducing resistance to infections. Malnourished children are more vulnerable to any infection than normal children. The overall under five child mortality rate has reduced from 74.3 (NFHS-3) to 49.7 (NFHS-4) deaths per thousand live births.   </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Anganwadi Services under the Umbrella Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme, aim to improve the nutritional and health status of children in the age-group of 0-6 years, pregnant women and lactating mothers and reduce the incidence of mortality, morbidity and malnutrition. Under the scheme, a package of six services is provided through a network of 13.77 lakh Anganwadi Centres in the country.  These services include supplementary nutrition, pre-school non-formal education, nutrition &#038; health education, immunization, health check-up and referral services. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">While opening the AWCs, States/UTs are advised to open these centres in the areas inhabited by SC, ST and weaker sections of the society. The scheme is universal, open to all the covered beneficiaries but is self-selecting.  There is no economic, social, educational or any other condition attached to the scheme. </p>
