<p style="text-align:justify">National Highway projects worth approximately Rs 10,000 crore have been approved in this financial year (till 31.10.2019) under the hybrid annuity mode. The objective is to maximize the quantum of implemented projects within the available financial resources of the Government and to revive private sector participation in the sector. Toll fee collection from the highways projects developed under the hybrid annuity model is the responsibility of the Government/Authority.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In order to tap the benefit of long term funds like pension fund, insurance fund, wealth fund etc into road construction sector, MoRTH has introduced models like HAM and TOT (Toll-Operate-Transfer).</p>
