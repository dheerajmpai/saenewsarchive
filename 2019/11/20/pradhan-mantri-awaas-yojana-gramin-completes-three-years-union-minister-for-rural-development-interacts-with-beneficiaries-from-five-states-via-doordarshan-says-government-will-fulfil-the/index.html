<p style="text-align:justify">Union Minister for Rural Development Shri Narendra Singh Tomar today interacted with the beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G) from 5 States namely Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Assam, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh from the Doordarshan studios in New Delhi and heard their testimonies. Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana was launched on 20th November 2016 with an aim of providing housing for all in rural areas. PMAY-G has completed three years today and on this occasion Rural development minister today interacted with the beneficiaries.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">While interacting with beneficiaries across these five States, Shri Tomar said that although a housing scheme for rural poor was in existence before the Prime Minister Narendra Modi led Government, its implementation was poor and was stuck in a lot of red-tape. He said that under the guidance of Prime Minister’s vision, PMAY-G scheme was launched on 20th November 2016 and it was made more comprehensive as it included amenities like water, gas, toilet and electricity supply in all the households. Under the PMAY-G, houses are being constructed using New Technologies. Time for Construction of Houses under the scheme has reduced to 114 days from 314 days in 2015-16 due to use of direct benefit transfer (DBT) platform. Under PMAY, the minimum size of a house has also been increased to 25 square meters.</p>

This will complete Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s dream of housing for all in Rural India by 2022. Shri Tomar further said that Government has ensured that all houses constructed under PMAY-G are designed properly by experts who have made it on the basis of topology and they are climate resistant homes. The common thing said by most beneficiaries was that their lives have been transformed after getting a ‘pucca’ house and it has boosted their self-esteem, social status and standard of living.</p>
