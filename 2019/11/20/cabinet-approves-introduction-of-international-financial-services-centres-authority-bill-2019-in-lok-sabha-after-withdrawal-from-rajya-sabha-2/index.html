<p style="text-align:justify">Benefits</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Currently the banking, capital markets and insurance sectors in IFSC are regulated by multiple regulators i.e. RBI, SEBI and IRDAI.  The dynamic nature of business in the IFSCs necessitates a high degree of inter-regulatory coordination.  It also requires clarifications and frequent amendments in the existing regulations governing financial activities in IFSCs. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The development of financial services and products in IFSCs would require focused and dedicated regulatory interventions.  Hence a need is felt for having a unified financial regulator for IFSCs in India to provide world class regulatory environment to financial market participants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Further, this would also be essential from an ease of doing business perspective. The unified authority would also provide the much needed impetus to further development of IFSC in India in-sync with the global best practices. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Background</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Union Cabinet in its meeting held on February 6, 2019 had approved the proposal for establishment of a unified authority for regulating all financial services through the introduction of the International Financial Services Centres Authority Bill 2019 in the Parliament.  Subsequently, the International Financial Services Centres Authority Bill, 2019 was introduced in the Rajya Sabha on February 12, 2019 by the then Hon’ble Minister of State (Finance).</p>
