<p style="text-align:justify">The Minister said that Complete Draft NRIC in Assam was published on 30th July 2018 and the final NRIC had been published on 31st August 2019 after the disposal of claims and objections. He noted that any person, not satisfied with the outcome of the decisions of the claims and objections may prefer appeal, before a designated Foreigners Tribunal constituted under The Foreigners (Tribunal) Order, 1964, within a period of 120 days from the date of such order.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Minister also remarked that the matter of deportation would arise only after the disposal of appeals by the Foreigners Tribunal.  He added that powers vested in the Central Government to deport an illegal migrant under the Foreigners Act, 1946 have been entrusted to Government of Assam under article 258(1) of the Constitution of India and thus, the Government of Assam is competent to deport an illegal migrant after his nationality is verified, if so required.</p>
