There are many films already done on the subject. But this is a story about whether people accept or don’t accept refugees in Europe and most cases they don’t. It serves a metaphor to explore the xenophobic fog prevalent in the region.” He said</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The director also used the film to explore his own thoughts on the refugee problem. “I also thought about what would I do if I met an abandoned kid, do I take him with me? Or leave him. That’s how I developed the story,” he added.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Mariella Li Sacchi, one of the producers also speaking at the conference stated that she had admired Goran’s work and when she got a ‘chance to read the screenplay, she loved it.’ “The film isn’t a mainstream film, but a political statement. The theme speaks about the big problem in Europe and especially in Italy. It gets worse everyday. I liked that the film didn’t have a documentary style but poetic approach.” Sacchi said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Ali Mousa, the little star who played the refugee in the film said, “I was happy because Gorang helped me. I learned from the big actors how to promote the film.” </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">When asked about finding a solution towards the refugee problem, the director said that the only way forward was ‘not to create wars.’ “No one wants to leave their homes, friends and culture.” He said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The film journeys into the plight of refugees who are abandoned on the streets. In the film, Paolo, a manager at a restaurant finds an eight-year-old child on the cold streets and decides to take him home. The director delves into how society reacts to the presence of the child.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Asian premier at the film festival will have the actors Paolo Triestino, Alessandra Cotogno and others at the inaugural ceremony in Panjim today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Award winning Serbian director Goran who has worked in countless films also spoke about the film he made in India, Dev Bhoomi.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It was distributed on Amazon Prime and had 10 million views across the world. “This is my love letter to India. It was shot in Uttarkhand and had a very simple yet emotional story,” he said about how he fell in love in India.</p>
