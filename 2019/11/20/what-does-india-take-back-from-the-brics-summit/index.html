<p>BRICS is currently a group of five major developing economies. Initially, the bloc included only four nations and was termed as BRIC, as South Africa became a member of the bloc only in 2010.</p>
<p>As leaders did voice upon the questions of multilateralism in the summit, prime minister Modi has articulated a vision for strengthening and reforming the multilateral system itself. He has underlined India&#8217;s outlook for multilateralism, and made it clear that it isn’t a step to reinforce the status quo of multilateralism but to reform it since this is what BRICS had originally planned to do.</p>
<p>During the plenary session, Modi stressed on intra-BRICS trade and goods and services, and welcomed the BRICS joint statements endorsement on reformed multilateralism.</p>
<p>The Summit will be an opportunity for India to lay the groundwork for hosting the 2021 Summit scheduled in India. The last Summit took place in Goa in 2016. India will also be mindful of the fact that the G20 Summit to be hosted in India will take place in 2022, and this will not only be an opportunity to synergise the two agendas from New Delhi’s lens but also to exercise the best diplomatic and beneficial instruments for Indian foreign policy to foster.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Prime Minister underlined the importance of a rule-based world order which represents diversity, equality and prosperity. He stressed on the challenges to sovereignty arising from factors like terrorism which seeks to undermine the nation-state.<br />
