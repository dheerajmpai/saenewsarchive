<p style="text-align:justify">Use of AIS-140 compliant NavIC-based vehicle trackers system has been made compulsory to all commercial vehicles. More than 75 companies are now manufacturing NavIC based vehicle trackers, and several thousand vehicles are now plying on the roads equipped with these devices. The updated version of new mobile models will be having NavIC based positioning systems. NavIC has been accepted by 3GPP (Third Generation Project Partnership) thereby enabling incorporation of NavIC as part of assisted GNSS. NavIC is also useful for applications like timing solution, drones, surveying, weather radiosondes, forestry, precision agriculture, etc.</p>
