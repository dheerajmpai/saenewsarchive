<p style="text-align:justify">The IBC envisages reorganisation and insolvency resolution of corporate persons, partnership firms and individuals in a time bound manner for maximisation of value of assets of such persons, to promote entrepreneurship, availability of credit and balance the interests of all stakeholders. The provisions of the IBC relating to corporate processes (insolvency resolution, fast track resolution, liquidation and voluntary liquidation) have since been operationalised.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">There are occasions when a corporate debtor (CD) takes a loan guaranteed by another corporate person (corporate guarantor to the CD) or an individual (personal guarantor to the CD). The lender may pursue a remedy against the guarantor or the CD, being principal borrower, when there is a default in repayment of the loan. The insolvency resolution of corporate guarantors to the CD and of personal guarantors to the CD complement insolvency resolution of the CD. Accordingly, the IBC provides that where an application for insolvency resolution or liquidation proceeding of a CD is pending before a National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), an application relating to insolvency resolution or liquidation or bankruptcy of a corporate guarantor or a personal guarantor shall be filed before the NCLT. It further provides that insolvency resolution, liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding of a corporate guarantor or a personal guarantor of the CD pending in any court or tribunal shall stand transferred to the NCLT dealing with insolvency resolution or liquidation proceeding of such CD.</p>
