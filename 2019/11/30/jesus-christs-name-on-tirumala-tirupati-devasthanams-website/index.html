<p>Jesus Christ&#8217;s name appeared on the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam&#8217;s website. The name ‘Shri Yesayya’ (<strong>శ్రీయేసయ్య</strong> or Shri. Jesus Christ) appeared to have been inserted in an earlier version of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam&#8217;s panchangam document. The document is now updated and has no name of Jesus anymore. While the google&#8217;s <a href="http://archive.ph/CqcBv">cached version </a>(extracted text from the previous PDFs) of the document still contains the word &#8216;Shri Yesayya&#8217;, meaning &#8216;Shri Jesus Christ&#8217;. And the google search results also shows the name <a href="http://archive.ph/IeXNG">&#8216;Jesus&#8217;</a></p>

<p>The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams has been in the news in recent times due to issues related to evangelical conversions, Books praising Jesus Christ on TTD’s website, Propagating Christianity by advertising ‘Jerusalem Yatra’ on bus tickets of Tirumala etc.</p>



<p>Recently Jai Hindustan Party has caught 10 TTD employees offering prayers in a Church and submitted the evidence to the Executive Officer of TTD. Issues like this are occurring very frequently in Tirumala.<br><br>Both the current Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy and Former Chief Minister Chandra Babu Naidu were criticised for hurting the sentiments of devotees for appointing Non-Hindus to the highest governing board of TTD and for propagating christianity in Tiruamala.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Recently the head priest of Chilukuru Balaji Temple, Shri. C S Rangarajan has stirred a discussion on State Control of Hindu Temples. He said that Hindu Temples are taxed at 23.5% while the religious institutions of other religions are not taxed. A legislator from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has introduced a private members bill to remove state control of Hindu Temples. Amid this, the devotees are speaking up on social media asking the elected leaders to safeguard their religious rights.</p>
