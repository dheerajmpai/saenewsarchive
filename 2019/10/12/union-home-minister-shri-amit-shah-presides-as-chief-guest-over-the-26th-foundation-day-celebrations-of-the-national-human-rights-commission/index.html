Also present was Justice Shri HL Dattu, Chairperson, NHRC.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Shri Shah, praising the work done by NHRC, said that the organization had, over the last 26 years, created immense awareness about human rights in people. He added that the concept of human rights as applied in India was very different from that as applicable globally. He remarked that this was so because traditional Indian social structures and institutions have been the inherent protectors of several human rights, without any legal obligation needed to enforce this protection. He said that this shows the richness of our culture, and that protection and promotion of human rights has always been an indelible part of our culture. He said that ensuring synergy between our cultural values and the modern approach to human rights would make India the best in the world in terms of human rights. </span></span></p>
