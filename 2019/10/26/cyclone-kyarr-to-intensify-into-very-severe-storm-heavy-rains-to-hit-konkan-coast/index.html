<p>Cyclone storm ‘Kyarr’ is very likely to intensify into a ‘Very Severe’ Cyclonic Storm on Saturday, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) said.</p>



<p>According to the IMD, the weather is likely to further intensify during the subsequent 24 hours and is likely to move west-northwest-wards towards Oman coast during next 5 days.</p>



<p>This is going to result in “light to moderate” rainfall at most places with heavy rainfall over coastal districts of Karnataka, Goa and South Konkan during the next 12 hours.</p>



<p>&nbsp;IMD has advised fishermen not to venture into, along and off the Konkan coast and Northeast Arabian Sea during next 24 hours.</p>
