<p>Dixon Technlogies on Friday said that it has entered into an agreement with Samsung India Electronics for manufaturing mobile feature phones.</p>



<p>Samsung recently ended mobile telephone production in China due to intensifying competition from domestic rivals as it expands its facility in India.</p>



<p>India now has 268 mobile manufacturing companies including some of the biggest players while there were just two five years back.</p>



<p>Dixon Technologies is the largest home-grown, design-focused and solutions company engaged in manufacturing consumer durables, lighting products and mobile phones, according to a recent study by global consulting major Frost &amp; Sullivan.</p>



<p>The company has been associated with Samsung home appliances segment for the past two years. Dixon will manufacture these phones from its new facility spread across 2.24 lakh square feet in Noida.</p>
