<p>Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday flagged off 104 new CNG buses from a bus depot at Dwarka Sector 22.</p>



<p>The buses feature CCTV cameras, panic buttons, and hydraulic lifts for the differently-abled amongst other unique features.</p>



<p>The initiative comes four days before travel would be made free of cost for women on Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and cluster buses in the national capital.</p>



<p>Speaking at the event, Kejriwal said that it is a huge step towards proving convenience to the people and will strengthen Delhiâ€™s public transport.</p>



<p>Last month, Kejriwal had announced the deployment of over 5,500 ex-home guards as marshals on the DTC and cluster buses plying in the national capital to ensure the safety of women.</p>
