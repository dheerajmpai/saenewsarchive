<p>NASA astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir will venture outside the International Space Station to replace faulty equipment on the stationâ€™s exterior in a first ever all-female spacewalk on 18 October 7:50 a.m. EDT.</p>



<p>It is the first spaceflight for both women who were selected in 2013 as a part of the first class of astronaut candidates of which 50% were women.
