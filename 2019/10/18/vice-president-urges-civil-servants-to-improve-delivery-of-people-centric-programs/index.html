<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white">“<span style="color:#222222">As the President of IIPA, I take immense pleasure in presiding over this 65<sup>th</sup> Annual Meeting of the General Body of the Institute. I welcome all the eminent members, various awardees and other guests.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Friends, As the entire world celebrates the 150<sup>th</sup> birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi this year, I would like all of us to remember his timeless legacy and some of his thoughts on national development. For Gandhiji, “constructive programme which is designed to build up the nation ‘from the very bottom upward’, was the truthful and non-violent way of winning Poorna Swaraj”.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Ensuring that all citizens enjoyed basic freedoms and a peaceful and good quality of life was the primary objective of Gandhiji’s constructive programme.  </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">What goes into the constructive programme can vary with time as Gandhiji himself said.  </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">But what is important is the vision of national development.  </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">What is remarkable is the bottom-up approach of grass-root level transformation and active involvement of citizens in development.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">This overarching vision can provide the inspiration for our country’s relentless efforts to reform administration and transform governance. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Institutions like IIPA should be knowledge hubs, exchanging information and knowledge and catalyzing this transformative process. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">I am happy to note that IIPA has been making rapid progress over the years in this direction. It has done commendable work both in Capacity Building as well as in Research. The IIPA training, hitherto limited to the Central Government officers has now expanded to the State Governments and Foreign Governments too.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">The Judicial Officers of the State of Uttar Pradesh are now being trained by IIPA along with officers of Indian Revenue Service and other central services. Foreign officials are also being trained by IIPA under ITEC programme of Ministry of External Affairs as also under other programmes, which is quite appreciable.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">I am also happy to note that IIPA is collaborating with foreign government institutions in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, France and the USA, among others. These efforts of IIPA are creating a culture of excellence and blending academic rigour with a policy orientation.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">I am aware that IIPA, apart from imparting training, is working closely with various government departments and organizations in providing policy and research advisory. The faculty of IIPA are evaluating the schemes of Department of Post, Ministry of Youth Affairs &amp; Sports, Rural Development, Ministry of Tribal Affairs and MeitY in a big way.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Similarly, the functioning of the newly created AIIMS in different states is also being evaluated by IIPA as also, the audit of Government hospitals of Delhi which is a commendable job.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">I am also happy to note that Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Government of India, has started a new Centre on Tribal research. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and the Ministry of Commerce are also planning similar initiatives on service standardization at IIPA. Already the Centres of IIPA&#8211; Centre for Consumer Studies (CSS) and Centre for Urban Studies (CUS) are enhancing the development objectives of the respective ministries. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">I welcome Shri S N Tripathi who has recently joined as Director IIPA. The Faculty and Officers of IIPA have been working hard and under the guidance of Shri Chaturvedi ji and the new Director, I am sure, they would be able to perform even better.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">I have also learned that the financial condition of IIPA has improved in the last five years but its long term liabilities have also increased and have reached Rs.97 Crore. It is a matter of concern and we should find a way to improve the Institute’s financial situation. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Since IIPA has been engaged in the evaluation of many schemes of the Government of India, its academic circle is fully aware that the focus of the current government is on people-centric schemes which can transform the lives of each citizen in the country. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">I am sure IIPA’s evaluations are being done with scientific rigour and are providing answers to key questions on the quality of programmes.  </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">India is moving fast towards major transformation.

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">India is establishing a skill ecosystem that equips its youth, comprising two thirds of its population, with the skills required for the 21<sup>st</sup> century through the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY).</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">The draft National Education Policy seeks to enrich the human resources of the country. The focus is on fully harnessing the inner talent and energy in the country to realize the demographic dividend and propel the country to move into a higher development trajectory. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Clearly, Indian government is keen to unleash the forces of growth and is not only making Indian an attractive investment destination but also making every Indian an active agent of change.  </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Swach Bharat is a classic example of societal transformation in which extraordinary results are made possible through active involvement of people.  This is the kind of approach which seems to hold great promise in most of the societal projects.  </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">In the case of infrastructure projects, public-private partnerships seem to be a promising modality. Digitalization and simplification of archaic procedures seems to have streamlined service delivery. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">I do hope IIPA’s evaluations will help the government to further improve the effectiveness and efficiency in all these programmes. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">I also wish that you should collate best practices from within the country and abroad and prepare policy briefs for fostering innovation at various levels. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Your research and evaluation studies must be shared widely and should become the basis for your training programmes.  </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Ultimately, it is the successful implementation that is the touchstone of effective governance.  </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">We are painfully aware of the numerous gaps between the noble intentions of a good policy and a poorly executive programme. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">That’s the moment IIPA has to step in and play a constructive role. You need to identify the gaps in implementation, the inadequacies and inefficiencies. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">You must provide the requisite knowledge and skills to the personnel to bridge this gap. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">IIPA has a long history of over six decades as a premier think-tank. It has played a laudable role.  But we should not rest on our past laurels. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">We should reposition IIPA in the light of current and emerging challenges. We have to come up with a sound strategy for institutional reforms and make IIPA a fit organization to catalyse the new wave of governance reforms. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">I am glad that IIPA has a strong network of institutions at the State and local level as well as a growing number of distinguished alumni.

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">I suggest that we constitute a small group of IIPA members to examine how we can make this Institute an even better resource centre for the country.

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">I wish to see IIPA set new ambitious goals in the next few months, benchmarking itself as one of the best institutions with similar mandate around the globe.</span></span></span></span></p>
