<p>CBI officials arrested former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram for allegedly flouting the conditional FIPB approval, and brought in over ₹305 crores of FDI against the approved inflow of over&nbsp;&nbsp;₹4 crores for INX Media. As per the charge sheet of CBI, 14 members are accused under the Prevention of Corruption Act, including the Karti Chidambaram,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the promoter director of Chess Management, Peter Mukerjea and the Indrani Mukerjea, both worked for the INX Media.<br>It is alleged that the office of the finance ministry is misused to illegal gains through the channel of Foreign Direct Investment. The case is linked with the Money Laundering through the channel of Foreign Direct Investment. Money Laundering cases are rising since the Liberalization, Privatization and Globalization (LPG) Reforms in the 1990s. Foreign Direct Investment picked up enormously after reforms. Along with it, the concern of tax evasions is raised.<br>Central Bureau of Investigation(CBI) and the Enforcement Department is involved in the investigation of this case. Enforcement Department deals with the cases, through investigation, related to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, and also to attach the assets involved in money laundering. CBI majorly deals with economic crimes and other special crimes. At present, CBI is also expanding to probe the other FDI clearances during the period of P.Chidambarm as the Finance Ministry.<br>Both the departments are strongly working on the current case and it also makes a strong echo that even the political stalwarts could not get an exception to misuse their office for the personal gains. At one point in time, everyone has to justify their actions.
