<p>Supreme Court is headed to declare its verdict on long-disputed Ayodhya case, before the retirement of Chief Justice of India, Ranjan Gogoi, i.e. before November 17. If not, again the case needs to be heard fresh.<br>In the march, this year, Supreme Court constituted the three-member mediation panel headed by former SC judge Justice F M Kalifullah to resolve the issue.<br>The highest court is hearing the case against the 2010 Allahabad High Court judgment. The high court divided the 2.77 hectares disputed land into four parts including the place, where Babri Masjid was located among the Sunni Central Waqf Board, UP,  Nirmohi Akhara, and Ramlalla Virajman.<br>In the meantime, Sunni Waqf Board is ready to drop its claim to the disputed temple-mosque site in Ayodhya and said it has no objection to the land being taken over by the government for building a Ram Temple, a mediation panel of the Supreme Court has said in its report.<br>If we see the arguments to fetch the land from both the parties, on one hand, the Hindu side claim is that Lord Ram was born exactly at the central dome of the Babri Masjid, which was demolished by Kar Sevaks in the year 1992. It is also mentioned in the Skanda Purana that Ramjanmabhoomi is a sacred religious place for the Hindus. The Mughal Emperor Babur built the mosque in the 16th century, by demolishing the temple. They also cited the pictures of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) representing the religious scriptures belonging to the Hindus.<br>On the other side, Muslims claim is that there is no empirical evidence to show that the place is exactly the birthplace of Lord Ram. They also rejected ASI&#8217;s pictographic evidence, as there is no single massive structure belonging to the Hindus.<br>If one sees from the perspective of national integrity, the case is about to deal with the fabric of religious harmony established by India. Even if one party does not agree with the verdict, communal clashes would rise. So, the Home Minister Amit Shah, said, &#8220;Hope Both parties accept the verdict&#8221;.</p>
