<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Police Observer was removed for not performing the task of observation satisfactorily. On the basis of input regarding progress of photo voter slip distribution, which is very important to inform each and every elector timely, it was found that the performance of an Assembly Constituency in Nashik district was very poor. Reviewing this, the  Commission ordered replacement of the RO 125 Nashik West.  The new officers will join today.</span></span></p>
