The Chief Minister of Goa along with the KVIC Chairman recently distributed electric potter wheels to 160 families and new models Charkhas (spinning wheels) to 50 trained women. This will create direct employment to 700 people. KVIC is also establishing a Lijjat Papad unit in Goa, which will create 200 direct jobs to the local women. It may be noted that these initiatives are first of its kind in Goa because there was no spinning and weaving activity, no Lijjat Papad unit in Goa earlier. Further for the first time electric potter wheels have been given to replace the traditional potter wheel which was highly labour intensive and less efficient in terms of production. KVIC has already helped 1,000 people to get employment with these initiatives. </p>

The move will assist the locals and help in creation of jobs. Chairman KVIC Mr. Saxena said that KVIC will create 10,000 new jobs in the current financial year in Goa. Chief Minister Mr. Sawant expressed his happiness and thanked KVIC for taking these unique initiatives for creating job opportunities to the local people in a record time.</p>
