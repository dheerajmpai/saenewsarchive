<p>All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) moved to challenge the Supreme Courts verdict on triple talaq on Monday. The recent Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, criminalises triple talaq among muslims.</p>



<p>The petition was filed by advocate M R Shamshad on behalf of the law board. </p>



<p>The act makes instant triple talaq a cognizable offence and the accused can be arrested without a warrant which can attract up to three years of imprisonment and a fine.</p>
