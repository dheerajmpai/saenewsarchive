<p>Shahi Litchi, the luscious fruit of Bihar, is now brought down to South India and will be available in the winter as well.</p>



<p>After training fruit growers, the cultivation has begun in Wayanad, Idukki and Kalpeta in Kerala, Kodagu, Chikmanglur and Hassan in Karnataka, and Palani Hills and Ooty in Tamil Nadu.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Specially famous for its sweet flavour and fragrance, Bihar&#8217;s Shahi Litchi is a brand in itself with a GI tag of its own. One ripe Shahi Litchi is likely to weigh around 40 gram. </p>



<p>According to Vishal Nath, director of the National Litchi Research Institute, the weather in these areas in the south is ideal for readying the produce in winter months of November and December.</p>
