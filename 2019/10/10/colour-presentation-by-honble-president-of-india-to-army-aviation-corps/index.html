Immediately after its raising in 1986, the Army Aviation Corps proved its impeccable combat credentials during &#8216;Operation Pawan&#8217; in Sri Lanka. The Siachen Glacier has been the ultimate operational frontier for the Corps since 1984. Routinely operating at 20000 feet and above in extremely challenging conditions, the highly skilled and motivated pilots of the Corps have been supporting &#8216;Operation Meghdoot&#8217; with skill and dedication.</span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">   </span></span></p>
