These can’t be achieved overnight. He said that these are exciting times, as sportspersons have started getting livelihood, recognition and respect because of their achievements.

He said Cricket has become very popular in the country, being played in every nook and corner of the country. The Government didn’t have much role in that, as the Government has a catalyst role only, which it is doing to its best. The sports ministry is doing needful to provide world class facilities to the athletes. He called for high standard of governance in the arena of sports, by the Governments, administrators, federations and industry. The minister said that mediocrity will not be accepted. All the stakeholders have to deliver, results will follow.  Kabbadi has recently become an in-thing, and its players have become celebrities. </span></span></p>
