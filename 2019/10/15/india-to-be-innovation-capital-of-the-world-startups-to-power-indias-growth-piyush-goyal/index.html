He further added that countries of the world cannot develop when few countries are giving subsidies and nurturing an eco system of unfair trade and competition among industries.Itis the need of the hour to have a more balanced development across the world and distributed sources of wealth creation, said Piyush Goyal.

He hoped that there will be more FDI in the energy sector as 100% FDI is allowed in this sector and there is requirement of around 70 billion USD investment in India’s energy sector which is on the cusp of a revolution as there is great demand for energy in India because the country hopes to achieve self-sufficiency in domestic production of the energy requirements for every household. During this interaction he further informed that the India &#8211; US relations are robust with great potential to move forward and it is time for India &#8211; US relations to make a quantum leap if tradebetween the two countries has to reach half trillion USD. </span></span></p>

There is need for a healthy mix of all commercial energy sources and India is today on the path of energy transition where 95% of households have access to electricity in the country today but there is increasing demand for energy which has to be fulfilled if India has to achieve the target of 450 megawatts set by Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi.</span></span></p>
