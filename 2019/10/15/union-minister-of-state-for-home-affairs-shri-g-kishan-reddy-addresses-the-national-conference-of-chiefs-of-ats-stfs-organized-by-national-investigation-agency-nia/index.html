<p style="text-align:justify"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",Times,serif; font-size:18px'>Shri Reddy remarked that India&#8217;s national security challenges were functions of its unique geography, diversity and regional as well as global developments.

He emphasized that all problems and grievances should be solved peacefully within the constitutional provisions of the nation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",Times,serif; font-size:18px'>Giving the example of Jammu and Kashmir, Shri Reddy said that the state of Jammu and Kashmir, despite being in India, was acting as a separate sovereign state due to disruptive and separatist activities. He added that the Government of India has merged the state of Jammu and Kashmir with India by removing Article 370. He noted that with the abrogation of Article 370, the Government has succeeded in crushing cross border sponsored terrorism to a and there would be all-round development of Jammu and Kashmir as well as Ladakh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",Times,serif; font-size:18px'>Shri Reddy said that the biggest challenge before the Government was to ensure a peaceful environment in the country so that the fruits of development reach everyone.

He noted that the extent of cyberspace is wider than the national boundaries and therefore exercising effective jurisdiction over it is a very difficult task. He said that the only way to deal with this problem effectively is through international cooperation and coordination between all stakeholders.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:18px">Shri Reddy said that for decades India had waged a patient fight against terrorism, and that the Government is determined to eradicate terrorism completely. He hailed the success of security forces in bringing peace to the states of Punjab, North-East of India, Kashmir and parts of the country affected by Left Wing Extremism as a barometer of the security forces and agencies. He said that as the world&#8217;s largest democracy, India has a duty to support the international community in fighting the menace of terrorism.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:18px">Shri Reddy expressed confidence that after the seminar there would be better coordination between ATS /STF of different states and they would emerge stronger and stronger to deal with different aspects of terrorism. </span></span></p>
