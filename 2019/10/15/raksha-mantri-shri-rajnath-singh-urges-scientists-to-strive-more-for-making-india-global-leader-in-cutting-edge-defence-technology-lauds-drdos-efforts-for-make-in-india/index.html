<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Raksha Mantri was speaking at the inaugural session of the 41<sup>st</sup> Directors’ Conference of Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), with the theme ‘Technology Leadership for Empowering India’, on the occasion of 88<sup>th</sup> birth anniversary of former President Bharat Ratna Dr A P J Abdul Kalam, here today. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Emphasising that research and maintaining operational superiority is the need of the hour, Shri Rajnath Singh said, the world is changing and advanced &amp; disruptive technologies are emerging at a rapid pace. He called for developing ‘indigenous innovation ecosystem’ with less dependence on imported systems to achieve self-reliance in critical technologies. “Development of technology should be cost effective and time efficient,” he added.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Stressing the need to bridge the technology gap for India to become a global leader in research and development, Raksha Mantri urged the scientists to focus on technologies that provide cutting edge capability and remain relevant for the next 15-20 years. “There are certain limitations in technology and there is a gestation period for development of products. It is possible that during the gestation period of complex systems, new technical requirements emerge. Spiral development should be given priority for such systems,” he further said.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Suggesting an intense interaction between DRDO and all stakeholders, Shri Rajnath Singh urged scientists to devise an action plan for excellence in Defence R&amp;D that can take India to renewed heights in defence capability. He said, with concerted efforts, India can become a ‘technology exporter’, which will have multi-dimensional benefits. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Raksha Mantri termed scientific knowledge, innovation, advanced technology, industrial infrastructure and workforce as ‘currency’ of modern times, adding that basic R&amp;D in science and technology identifies new knowledge that can prove to be useful in both civil and military sectors. “Innovation brings investment and at the same time provides better value to investors. It contributes in establishing a win-win situation,” he said.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Shri Rajnath Singh added that through initiatives such as ‘Make in India’, investment facilitation, skills enhancement, intellectual property protection and manufacturing infrastructure, the Government is leaving no stone unturned to make India a global manufacturing hub in near future. </span></span></span></span></p>

He expressed confidence that the world-class weapon platforms and systems like combat vehicles, missiles, multi-barrel rocket launcher, unmanned aerial vehicle, radar, electronic warfare systems, combat aircraft, propellants &amp; explosives, will help in making India self-reliant in defence sector. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Raksha Mantri congratulated DRDO for achieving all targets earmarked for 100 days and lauded the organisation for setting a target to become fully self-reliant in the next five years.

He described DRDO, which started on a mission mode, as the symbol of capability and courage, similar to the life of Dr Kalam. Raksha Mantri said, DRDO has made the country strong and secure by providing cutting edge technologies and internationally competitive systems to the Armed Forces.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Echoing the words of Dr Kalam, “If you want to shine like a sun, first burn like a sun”, Raksha Mantri exhorted the scientists of DRDO to strive for excellence in all their endeavours.</span></span></span></span></p>
