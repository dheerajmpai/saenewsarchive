<p style="text-align:justify">The buildings on Raisina Hills were constructed in the period from 1911 to 1931, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyen and Sir Herbert Baker.  At that time, also these were designed to have office for viceroy &#038; Secretariat.  The Parliament building was constructed in the same period. Various buildings along Rajpath have been constructed at different stages for accommodating offices of various Central Govt. Ministries and Departments. The Central Vista starting from Rashtrapati Bhawan upto India Gate is the heart of city which has been point of attraction for visitors from all over the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Over a period of above 100 years after the conceptualisation of building on Raisina Hill and adjoining to Rajpath, the requirement has now increased manifold.  These buildings designed earlier are not now able to provide enough space, amenities and comfort requirement.  The requirement of safety standards have also got improved.  In terms of offices, now more space is required to accommodate all Central Govt. offices at nearby area.  Due to delimitation, more Nos. of MPs may be there in future and hence more space is required for them.  Even for present MPs, the space and amenities required is quite insufficient in Parliament House.Lots of visitors come to Central Vista from India &#038; abroad and there is an imperative need to improve the beauty of Central Vista to make it a world  class tourist attraction point. </p>
