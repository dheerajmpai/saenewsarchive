<p>BBC News is now available on the Tor network allowing it to be more securely accessed via the anonymising browser. The news organisation is putting its international edition on the network, with coverage available in a variety of languages including Arabic, Persian, and Russian.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The move is aimed at making the BBC’s news coverage available more securely in countries that attempt to restrict access to it such as China, Iran, and Vietnam. Although the Tor network is frequently associated with the dark web, but it’s also a vital tool for anyone looking to preserve their anonymity while accessing regular websites.</p>



<p>The BBC’s typical&nbsp;URL loads when visited via the Tor browser,&nbsp;but <em>BBC News</em>&nbsp;reports that using the “.onion” top level domain, prevents spoofing and preserves end-to-end encryption, making it a more secure way to access the news site.Facebook had also launched a similar mirror&nbsp;back in 2014.</p>
