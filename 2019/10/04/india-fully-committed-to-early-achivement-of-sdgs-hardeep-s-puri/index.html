<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Earlier the Minister complimented the UN-Habitat for choosing ‘Frontier Technologies as an innovative tool for transforming Waste to Wealth’ as the theme of this year’s World Habitat Day, thereby calling attention to the issue of waste, wishing to change the discourse into a positive one, where<span style="color:black"> waste is presented as an opportunity to bring about wealth and change in the communities and cities where we live.  This year’s theme also assumes much more significance in the light of focus of every nation to implement the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as well as the Habitat III ‘New Urban Agenda’ (NUA) which put special emphasis on sustainable waste management. Goal 11  of SDGs which talks about ‘making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable’, targets that “by 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management”. He reaffirmed that India was committed to achieving the SDGs before time. Frontier technologies—from DNA sequencing to 3D-printing, from renewable energy technologies to biodegradable plastics, from biofuel technologies to digital &amp; nanotechnologies, from machine learning to artificial intelligence—present immense potential for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in general and transforming waste to wealth in particular.  </span></span></span></p>
