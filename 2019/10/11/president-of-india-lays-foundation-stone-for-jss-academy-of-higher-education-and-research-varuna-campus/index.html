Yet, health remains a key development challenge for us. As a country we are challenged by the triple burden of communicable, noncommunicable and new and emerging diseases. Malnutrition and neglected tropical diseases place severe constraints on us. We need to improve access to health services.</span></span></span></span></p>

A nationwide revolution for cleanliness and health is already underway. It must continue and become stronger with each passing day.

Our solutions to meet our health challenges need to be broad-based and multi-pronged. They must use the power of both modern medicine and traditional knowledge. They must focus on both the mind and the body. They must involve both prevention and cure.</span></span></span></span></p>
