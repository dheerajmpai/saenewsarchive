<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:#222222">As per Hindu beliefs, today is the day when Lord Rama defeated the demon king <em>Ravana</em>. It is also believed that this is the day when Goddess <em>Durga</em> rid the world of the demon <em>Mahishasura</em>. </span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:#222222">Whichever epic you choose to believe in, it is clear that Dussehra symbolizes the victory of good over evil, of righteousness and virtue over sinfulness. </span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:#222222">The festival is a reminder to each and every one of us to tread the path of righteousness with unwavering commitment. As we burn the effigies of Ravana today, let us simultaneously burn all the demonic traits that lie dormant within us. </span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:#222222">To me, Dussehra is the celebration of eternal human values and morals.

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:#222222">Rama is supposed to be the embodiment of “dharma”, or righteous behaviour. </span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Lord Rama’s kingdom was in many ways an ideal kingdom. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:#222222">Let that resolute commitment to justice, good governance and welfare of the people continue to inspire us in our journey as a nation and help us make rapid progress on all fronts. </span></span></span></p>
