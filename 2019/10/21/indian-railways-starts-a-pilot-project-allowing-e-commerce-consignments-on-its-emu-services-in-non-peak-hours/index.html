This pilot project of booking consignments in EMU service is the first of its kind in Indian Railways.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The consignment is allowed to be carried in vendor compartment alongwith other vendors in non-peak hours (i.e. 11.00 hrs to 16.00 hrs.), thus causing no disruption/inconvenience to the existing system.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This project is to benefit both Railways and e-commerce company M/s. Amazon. Railway will be benefitted through generation of revenue without putting any additional stress or burden on existing system whereas Amazon will be benefitted through reduced transit time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The route viz. Sealdah to Dankuni was preferred by M/s. Amazon for quick movement of their consignment to the existing facility at Dankuni. Upon success of the pilot project, other routes may also be taken up by Amazon and other  e-commerce companies may also be interested.</p>
