<p>The Orionid meteor showers flanked by one of the brightest stars in the night sky&nbsp;will hit Earth&#8217;s atmosphere to energise and glow for a millisecond, something that happens as many as 40 times per hour to create this beautiful meteor shower. Although the shower runs from October 2 through November 7, the night to watch for shooting stars is Monday through Tuesday, October 21 and 22, 2019. The best time will be after midnight when your location will be on the nightside of Earth. So wrap up warm and let your eyes adjust to the dark and just watch the night sky (in this case, look generally southeast towards Orion). Whatever you do, don&#8217;t stop looking, and absolutely do not look at your smartphone as its white light will instantly kill your night vision.</p>



<p>Meteors come from leftover comet particles and bits from broken asteroids. The pieces of space debris that interact with our atmosphere to create the Orionids originate from Comet 1P/Halley. Each time Halley&#8217;s Comet returns once in 76 years to the inner solar system, its nucleus sheds ice and rocky dust into space. Every year the Earth passes through these debris trails, which allows the bits to collide with our atmosphere where they disintegrate to create fiery and colourful streaks in the sky and eventually become the Orionids in October and the Eta Aquarids in May.</p>
