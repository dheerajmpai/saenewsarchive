<p>Central Reserve Police Force (CPRF) units deployed in Jammu and Kashmir and Naxals area have planned to equip its dogs with cameras.</p>



<p>CPRF has been researching about these cameras for the past few months and have taken a few operational issues into consideration while purchasing the initial 25 cameras, according to a document. Officials claim that CPRF will be the first Indian force to purchase these cameras for its K9 unit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cameras will be placed on the back of dogs helping the handlers to understand what the dogs are viewing. They come with multiple qualities like high definition, water and scratch resistance.</p>



<p>The CPRF will conduct basic training for 50-60 personnel to handle the tactical electronic device, where they will be taught to handle, maintain and conduct minor repair of the equipment.</p>



<p>The equipment will help the force in situations where analysis is required before involving personnel. Various K9 units across the world are using these police dog cameras including the dog head camera and ‘K9cam’ to record activities of criminals.</p>
