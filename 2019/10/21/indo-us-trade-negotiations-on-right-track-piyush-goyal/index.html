He also informed the gathering that the Department of Commerce is also working to bring down the cost of logistics that have to be borne by manufacturing companies in India.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">According to USISPF estimates India-US bilateral trade is projected to grow to USD 238 billon by 2025. The assessment underscores the pathways for growth and economic opportunities in bilateral ties by highlighting current trends. Sectors like defence trade, commercial aircrafts, oil and LNG, coal, machinery and electronics are areas of potential growth in US investments and commerce into India. Indian industry has an opportunity to promote automotive, pharmaceuticals, seafood, IT and travel services to the US market.</p>
