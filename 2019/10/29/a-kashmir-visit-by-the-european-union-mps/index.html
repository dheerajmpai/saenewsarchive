PM Modi and NSA Ajit Doval briefed the MPs of the situation ahead of the visit.</p>
<p>This comes months after Article 370 was abrogated in Jammu and Kashmir on August 5.</p>
<p>PM Modi and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval briefed the delegation and discussed the issue of Kashmir and also about the situation there after the abrogation of Article 370. This decision arrived after the international gaze was turned towards Kashmir after Article 370 was abrogated.</p>
<p>The Twitter handle of former J&amp;K CM Mehbooba Mufti, said, &#8220;Hope they get a chance to speak to the people, local media, doctors and civil society members. The iron curtain between Kashmir and the world needs to be lifted and the government must be held accountable for pushing J&amp;K into turmoil.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 28-member delegation of the EU (European Union) parliamentarians met NSA Ajit Doval on Monday. The delegation also called on Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu on Monday. Kashmir has been under a communication lockdown ever since the government abrogated Article 370. There are still a number of restrictions including Section 144 which are in place in the Valley. While postpaid phones and landline services were resumed after over 70 days of abrogation.</p>
<p>The BJP lawmaker Subramanian Swamy has shown reluctance with the Centre for allowing a European parliamentary panel to visit Kashmir.</p>
<p>He also called the decision, &#8220;a perversion of national policy&#8221; and urged the centre to cancel the visit.</p>
