This marks a major reform of the guidelines for marketing of petrol and diesel. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The existing policy for granting authorization to market transportation fuels had not undergone any changes for the last 17 years since 2002. It has now been revised to bring it in line with the changing market dynamics and with a view to encourage investment from private players, including foreign players, in this sector. The new Policy will give a fillip to ‘Ease of Doing Business’, with transparent policy guidelines. It will boost direct and indirect employment in the sector. Setting up of more retail outlets (ROs) will result in better competition and better services for consumers </p>
