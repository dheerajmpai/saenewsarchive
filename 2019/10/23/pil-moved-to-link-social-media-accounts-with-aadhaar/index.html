<p>The plea was filed by advocate Ashwini Upadhyay and it seeks the central government’s direction to declare that the publication of ‘paid news’ and political advertisements during the last 48 hours before polls is a “corrupt practice” under Section 123(4) in The Representation of People Act, 1952.</p>



<p>Through this pleas, Upadhyay has sought the Centre’s direction to take appropriate steps for deactivation of fake, duplicate and ghost social media accounts. The plea also claimed that hundreds of fake Twitter and Facebook under the name of eminent personalities including the President and even judges of the Supreme Court were created to spread fake and paid news.</p>
