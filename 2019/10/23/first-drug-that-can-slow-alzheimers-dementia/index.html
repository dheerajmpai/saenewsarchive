<p>The first therapy that could slow Alzheimer&#8217;s disease has been created by a US drug company. <a href="http://investors.biogen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/biogen-plans-regulatory-filing-aducanumab-alzheimers-disease"><strong>Biogen</strong></a> says it will soon seek regulatory approval in the US for the &#8220;groundbreaking&#8221; drug, called aducanumab and plans to file paperwork by early 2020.</p>



<p>Aducanumab targets a protein called amyloid that forms abnormal deposits in the brains of people with Alzheimer&#8217;s. Scientists think these plaques are toxic to brain cells and that clearing them using drugs would be a massive advancement in dementia treatment, although not a cure.</p>



<p>The company says a new analysis of a larger dataset of the same studies shows that higher doses of aducanumab can provide a significant benefit to patients with early Alzheimer&#8217;s, slowing their clinical decline so they preserve more of their memory to help perform every day living skills, that the disease usually robs.</p>



<p>Dementia is not a single disease, but is the name for a group of symptoms that include problems with memory and thinking. There are lots of different types of dementia, and Alzheimer&#8217;s is said to be the most common. Currently, the existing treatments only help with symptoms and experts hope a viable treatment is in sight, but they are cautious and will need to closely scrutinise these aducanumab trial findings.</p>
