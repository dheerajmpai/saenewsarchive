<p style="text-align:justify">Calling for institutionalization of DHRUV programme, the Vice President said that it should become a movement across the country. He said that there was also a need to create permanent forums like Science Museums, Science Labs, Dance and Music courses. “Theatre and art should be part of our school curriculum.  I hope the Ministry will take up this task in the future,” he added. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Stressing the need to create the right conditions in schools, colleges and Universities for the spirit of excellence and innovation to thrive, Shri Naidu said that greater emphasis should be laid on quality education.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Under the DHRUV programme, talented students from science and performing arts from schools across India are brought together and mentored by experts to enhance their knowledge and skills. IIT Delhi in association with Atal Innovation Mission, NITI Aayog, NCERT, Sangeet Natak Academy, SPIC-MACAY and Center for Cultural Resources and Training, Delhi are involved in honing the innovative and creative skills of the students.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">“मानव संसाधन विकास मंत्रालय की इस अनूठी पहल &#8216; ध्रुव &#8216; के समापन समारोह पर आप सब के बीच उपस्थित हो कर हर्ष का अनुभव कर रहा हूं।</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">मुझे हर्ष है कि प्रधान मंत्री इन्नोवेटिव लर्निंग प्रोग्राम &#8216; ध्रुव &#8216; के तहत प्रतिभावान छात्रों को पहचान कर, उनके ज्ञान और शिल्प को और प्रोत्साहित तथा निखारा जाएगा। देश के उत्कृष्ट संस्थानों में इन मेधावी प्रतिभावान छात्रों को, विभिन्न क्षेत्रों जैसे कला, विज्ञान के प्रतिष्ठित विशेषज्ञों द्वारा प्रशिक्षित किया जाएगा, जिससे वे अपनी क्षमता और प्रतिभा को पूरी तरह निखार सकें।</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">मुझे विश्वास है कि &#8216; ध्रुव&#8217;, इन मेधावी छात्रों के जीवन में नया परिवर्तन लाएगा, उसे नई  दिशा देगा। यह इन छात्रों को एक मंच देगा जिससे वे अपनी रुचि के क्षेत्र में उत्कृष्टता हासिल कर सकें।</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I am delighted to be here today with all of you at the closing ceremony of ‘DHRUV’, a unique initiative of the Ministry of Human Resources Development.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I am glad to note that the Pradhan Mantri Innovative Learning Programme-‘DHRUV’, was started to identify and encourage talented children in order to enrich their skills and knowledge. In centres of excellence across the country, gifted children will be mentored by renowned experts in diverse areas, from science to performing arts, so that they can reach their full potential.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I am sure that ‘DHRUV’, will act as a turning point in the lives of extraordinarily talented students by acting as a platform for them to explore their talents and achieve excellence in their specific areas of interest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In acknowledgment of the importance of recognizing and nurturing exceptional talent, the Government of India has already envisioned and implemented a number of schemes, such as National Talent Search Examination, Kishor Vaigyanaik Protsahan Yojna (KVPY), Maths and Science Olympiads, the INSPIRE program and the Atal Innovation Mission.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It is timely and appropriate to design a well-rounded program for gifted and talented children in India. We need to give our children the best learning opportunities. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I am told that the first batch of ‘DHRUV’ consists of 60 students, 30 of who are exceptionally talented in Science and 30 of who are outstanding performing artists. I am happy to meet these 60 DHRUV TARAs from across the country. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It is indeed noteworthy that these young prodigies, between 13 and 16 years of age, are being mentored by organizations such as NITI Aayog, IIT-Delhi, The Energy Research Institute, SPIC-MACAY, NCERT, Cultural Resources and Training Centre etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I am confident that the collaborative efforts of DHRUV TARAs from science, mathematics and arts streams, under the guidance of their mentors will contribute greatly towards nation building by envisioning locally relevant, easy to implement solutions to address challenges of poverty, unemployment, disease, agricultural productivity, energy conservation and so on and so forth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Performing arts have the potential and innate power to connect with the masses. This power can and must be effectively leveraged to inform, educate and empower people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It is clear that the students who have completed the ‘DHRUV’ program have gained tremendous exposure and diverse experiences. Let me congratulate each and everyone of you ‘DHRUV TARAs’ or Pole Stars on completing this coveted program.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The fascinating legend of Dhruva, who, as a young boy, observed long penance to achieve the exalted position of the fixed Pole Star is widely narrated all over the country.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">‘DHRUV TARA’ is one of the brightest stars in the sky. It serves as a guiding beacon to the travellers on high seas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I am confident that each one of you will shine as bright as the North Star, leading this country forward in its pursuit of inclusive, sustainable development.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The entire team of Ministry of Human Resource Development working efficiently under the able leadership of the Minister for Human Resources Development, deserves a round of spirited applause for not only conceiving this innovation but also for effective planning and implementation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">My dear Young Students,  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Excellence is never an accident.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It is the result of determined hard work and dedication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Excellence is not a destination; it’s a continuous journey that never ends.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Innovation is critical for the progress of a nation. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">We must create the right conditions in our schools, colleges, universities for this spirit of excellence and innovation to thrive. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">We must place greater emphasis on the quality of education.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">We must create a culture of excellence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I am glad that the Dhruv programme is focussing both on science and performing arts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Education should be holistic. It should cover head, heart and hand. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Education must propel our children to move from the narrow confines of competition to the limitless world of collaboration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The world that we live in today faces challenges from poverty to climate change. Collective synergy and creative energy of our youngsters is needed to overcome these formidable obstacles. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I strongly believe that this excellence that we nurture in our educational institutions must fuel inclusive growth, peace and harmony.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I am confident that unique initiatives such as ‘DHRUV’ will help in kindling the fire for excellence and innovation in young people. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Both science and culture are essential for any civilization to flourish. Today’s India needs a scientific and technological renaissance as well as a cultural revitalization.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">मुझे आशा है कि ध्रुव की सफलता, इन मेधावी छात्रों को प्रशिक्षित करने के लिए, एक स्थाई संस्थागत कार्यक्रम बनाने का मार्ग प्रशस्त करेगी। ऐसे अनुकरणीय कार्यक्रम हर स्कूल, हर कॉलेज में किए जाने चाहिए, जिससे अधिक से अधिक मेधावी छात्रों को उत्कृष्टता हासिल करने के अवसर मिल सकें।</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I hope that the success of ‘DHRUV’ will lead to the establishment of a permanent program to mentor exceptionally talented young people. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Every student is unique. We have to recognise that talent and foster it. We must have schools that encourage creativity. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This programme was some sort of a pilot. We now need to institutionalize it.  We need to create permanent forums like science museums, science labs, dance and music classes. Theatre and art should be part of our school curriculum.  I hope the Ministry will take up this task in the future. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">मुझे विश्वास है कि आज के सभी &#8216; ध्रुव तारे &#8216; भविष्य में अपने रुचि के चुने हुए क्षेत्र में उत्कृष्टता के मानदंड स्थापित करेंगे और दूसरों के लिए प्रेरणा का स्रोत बनेंगे। आपके प्रयास देश को उपलब्धि की नई ऊंचाईयों पर ले जाएंगे।</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I am confident that all the ‘DHRUV TARAs’ present here will one day become inspirational leaders in their chosen fields. I hope the Minister for HRD, who is himself a poet, will ensure that there is equal emphasis on all aspects of education and that schools become centres of joyful, creative learning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Only then can the nation be propelled to a higher trajectory. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I am sure that the future of India is secure in the hands of its youth. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I once again wish each and every one of these gifted youngsters all the very best. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As we celebrate Diwali a few days from now, let me wish you a very happy Deepawali.  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I see before me a row of bright lights in each one of you here, lighting up our country’s future. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Thank You!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Jai Hind!”</p>
