Kiren Rijiju here today. Addressing the inaugural session, which was attended by SAI officials from all over India, the Minister said, “Each of us must maintain the highest level of personal integrity because we are custodians of SAI, and we cannot indulge in activities that harm or undermine this organization.” The minister also pointed out that a system of grading SAI centres on the basis of the level of integrity of officers working there, may also be considered. Welcoming the initiative of the two-day seminar, Shri Rijiju said that being vigilant should be a way of life, and must be observed not just during the Vigilance Awareness Week, but right throughout the year.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Sports Secretary Shri Radheyshyam Julaniya spoke on “Ethics in Sports” and said ethics and integrity is an individual matter and differs from person to person. Speaking on the difference between personal (one’s belief system) and public integrity (larger public good), he said, “One needs to reach a consensus between what is personal integrity and public integrity.” He added that when there is a conflict between the two, larger public good must prevail.</p>
