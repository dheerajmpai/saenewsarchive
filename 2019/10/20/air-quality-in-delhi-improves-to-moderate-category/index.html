According to SAFAR, the stubble burning activity in Haryana, Punjab, and nearby border regions have negligible influence on the Delhi region due to change in circulation pattern and the wet transport path.<br />
A forecast of faster deterioration in air quality from poor to the very poor category by October 22 is expected due to a change in direction of wind, moist condition and considerable bio mass plume transport. According to the organisation, further drastic deterioration (to several levels) in Air Quality Index (AQI) of Delhi is only expected by the first week of November. The western disturbance can positively influence Delhiâ€™s air quality as the crisis deepens if it is encountered with any additional internal (like firecrackers) or external emissions (stubble burning ) sources. With Diwali around the corner if local emissions are controlled, it will be a good check to observe the AQI.</p>
