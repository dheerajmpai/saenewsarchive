<p style="text-align:justify">In his Mann Ki Baat Programme on the 27th of October, 2019 Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged people to participate in large numbers in the ‘Run For Unity’ towards One Goal – “Ek Bharat Shreshth Bharat.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“Friends, as you know that 31st October every year since 2014 has been celebrated as &#8216;National Unity Day&#8217;. This day imparts the message to protect the unity, integrity and security of our country at any cost. On 31st October, this year too ‘Run for Unity’ is being organized like the previous years. ‘Run for Unity’ is a symbol of unison, that the nation being united, is moving in one direction and collectively aims for- One goal! Ek Bharat, Shreshth Bharat!”, he said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel integrated the nation with the thread of unison. This mantra of unity is like a sacrament in our life and in a country like ours filled with diversities, we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unison on all paths, at every bend, and at every pit-stop. My dear countrymen, our nation has always been very proactive and alert in strengthening unity and communal harmony in the country. If we look around us, we will find many examples of individuals who have been working ceaselessly to foster communal harmony.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Prime Minister further said, “the last five years have witnessed &#8211; not only in Delhi but in hundreds of cities of India, union territories, state capitals, district centres, even in small cities belonging to tier two or tier three categories, innumerable men, women, be they the city folk, village folk, children, the youth, the elderly, divyang, all are participating in ‘Run for Unity’ in large numbers.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Stressing on the importance of a Fit India, the Prime Minister said ‘Run for Unity’ is one such unique event which is beneficial for the mind, body and soul. “During ‘Run for Unity’ not only do we have to run, but in doing so the spirit of FIT India is also reflected. We also find ourselves connected with Ek Bharat- Shrestha Bharat! And so, not just our body, but our mind and value system get integrated with ushering unity in India to take India to loftier heights! “</p>
