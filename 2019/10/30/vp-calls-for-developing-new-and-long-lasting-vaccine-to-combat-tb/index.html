<p style="text-align:justify">Inaugurating ‘The 50th Union World Conference on Lung Health’ in Hyderabad today,  he referred to the contention that the effect of BCG vaccine being  administered for TB does not last for many years and said there was an absolute need for a booster vaccine or a new vaccine that is effective and long-lasting. The four day Conference is being attended by the delegates from 130 countries.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He expressed happiness that the Indian Government has initiated trials for testing new candidate vaccines.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Calling for addressing various causes that spread TB, including poverty and overcrowding, Shri Naidu said that prevention was the most effective way to control the spread of TB and said that more efforts were needed in that direction. Lifestyle disorders such as diabetes also increase the risk of TB, he pointed out.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Stressing the need for improved diagnostics to detect TB in organs other than lungs, he said that TB treatment saved around 58 million lives globally between 2000 and 2018 and the TB mortality rate fell by 42% during that period.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Expressing concern over the rising incidence of respiratory and lung-related diseases due to air pollution, he observed that exposure to ambient air pollution could lead to reduced lung function, respiratory infections and aggravated asthma. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Naidu called for measures to arrest this pressing problem by adopting a multipronged approach to reduce emissions of harmful gases, especially which come under PM 2.5 levels. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Quoting WHO data, he said ambient (outdoor air pollution) was a major cause of death and disease globally. An estimated 4.2 million premature deaths globally are linked to ambient air pollution, mainly from heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and acute respiratory infections in children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Lauding the government for adopting a multi-sectoral and community-led approach to eliminate TB from India by the year 2025, Shri Naidu urged the private sector to step up its efforts towards achieving the goal of eliminating TB by actively collaborating with the government. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Stating that Government of India was in the forefront of global action to end the emergency on account of the prevalence of Lung Disease and Tuberculosis, he said that the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has pledged a firm commitment to eradicate TB by the year 2025 </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Referring to the positive outcomes of initiatives such as the Revised National TB Control Program (RNTCP) that brought down TB incidence in India at an annual rate of 1.7%, the Vice President said Public and Private sector must work together to reach out to more TB patients and provide them affordable treatment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Describing Telangana as a dynamic and growing hub for innovative medical science and biomedical industry, the Vice President called upon the business leaders in the state to play a more pro-active role in supporting Research and Development in treatment, care and prevention of TB. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Observing that non-communicable diseases like cancer, diabetes and heart attack were accounting for huge spending by households, Shri Naidu said the problem could be surmounted to a large extent by ensuring Universal Health Coverage where every individual gets quality treatment without facing any financial hardship </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He said that programs such as AayushmanBharath were a step in the right direction to provide comprehensive insurance coverage to 10 crore poor and vulnerable families. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Governor of Telangana, Dr.TamilisaiSoundararajan, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, Shri Ashwini Kumar Chowbey, the Minister for Health and Family Welfare, Govt of Telangana, Shri EtelaRajendar, Dr.Jeremiah, President of the International Union Against TB and Lung Disease, Mr.Louis Castro, Shri M.Venkateshwarlu, President, TFCCI were among those present at the event.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Following is the full text of Vice President’s speech &#8211; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“Hon’ble Governor of Telangana, Dr.TamilisaiSoundararajan, Hon’ble Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, Shri Ashwini Kumar ChowbeyJi, Hon’ble Shri EtelaRajendar, Minister for Health and Family Welfare, Dr.Jeremiah, President of the International Union Against TB and Lung Disease, Mr.Louis Castro, Shri M.Venkateshwarlu, President, TFCCI.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">At the outset, let me appreciate the INTERNATIONAL UNION AGAINST TUBERCULOSIS AND LUNG DISEASE for hosting this international conference of high significance in Hyderabad, a happening city known for its biryani and IT sector. Of course, modern medical infrastructure is expanding and turning this city into one of the major centres of medical tourism in India.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The theme of conference,‘Ending the Emergency: Science, Leadership, Action’ quite aptly focuses on what is needed to ensure commitments become action so that lifesaving targets are met. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">According to the World Health Organization (WHO), TB was one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide in 2018. It is also the leading killer of people with HIV and a major cause of deaths related to antimicrobial resistance. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In 2018, there were an estimated 10 (9.0—11.1) million new TB cases worldwide, of which 1.1 million were children. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India is among the eight countries that accounted for 66% of the new cases&#8211; China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, and South Africa are the other nations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In 2018, it is estimated that about 1.5 million people died from TB. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">However, TB treatment saved around 58 million lives globally between 2000 and 2018 and the TB mortality rate fell by 42% during that period.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I am happy to note that the Government of India is in the forefront of global action to end the emergency on account of the prevalence of Lung Disease and Tuberculosis. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As you all are aware, the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has pledged a firm commitment to eradicate TB by the year 2025. It should be noted that India seeks to achieve the goal five years ahead of the globally agreed target. I am also pleased to note that the Government of India also launched ‘TB Harega, DeshJeetega” campaign and is adopting a multi-sectoral and community-led approach to eliminate TB by 2025.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I am told that the programs of the Revised National TB Control Program (RNTCP) have started yielding positive results and TB incidence in India has been coming down at an annual rate of 1.7%, although it is matter of concern that around 5.5 lakh cases went unreported last year. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Under the National Strategic Plan for ending TB, the RNTCP is strengthening the private sector engagement to reach out to more TB patients. It is extremely important for the private sector’s involvement in notifying TB patients and improving treatment outcomes. I feel the private sector must not only step up its efforts towards achieving the goal of eliminating TB but must actively collaborate with the government in this regard. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">On its part, the Government of India is making all efforts to ensure affordable health care for all and bring down the costs of TB diagnosis and treatment. I urge the private sector too focus on providing affordable treatment for TB patients.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I am told that an estimated 4.2 lakh people died from TB which is more than HIV, AIDS and malaria combined last year. It is also understood that around 27 lakh people were afflicted with TB and nearly 10 lakh patients of these did not receive a diagnosis or an adequate and proper treatment. Around 3.00 lakh children under the age of 15 years acquired TB through contact with infected family members. This should not be allowed to continue any longer. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has launched a National Prevalence Survey to estimate prevalence of tuberculosis at national and sub-national levels. The Government has made some success during the last one year in case finding, drug resistance surveys and in providing nutritional support to TB patients.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dear sisters and brothers, there is a need to address various causes that spread TB, including poverty and overcrowding. Prevention is the most effective way to control the spread of TB and more efforts are needed in that direction. Lifestyle disorders such as diabetes also increase the risk of TB.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I am told that the effect of BCG vaccine that is currently being administered for TB does not last for many years. There is an absolute need for a booster vaccine or a new vaccine that is effective and long-lasting. I am happy to note that the Indian Government has initiated trials for testing new candidate vaccines.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I am told that majority of people, who are infected, have innate immunity. Perhaps, in-depth studies could be take up to find out what protects them so that similar deficiencies could be addressed in people, who are vulnerable. Improved diagnostics are also needed for detecting TB in organs other than lungs,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Another major concern for all stakeholders in the health care sector is the growing incidence of respiratory and lung-related diseases due to air pollution. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">According to the World Health Organization, ambient (outdoor air pollution) is a major cause of death and disease globally. An estimated 4.2 million premature deaths globally are linked to ambient air pollution, mainly from heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and acute respiratory infections in children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In children and adults, both short- and long-term exposure to ambient air pollution can lead to reduced lung function, respiratory infections and aggravated asthma. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I am sure that all the specialists and experts, who gathered here, will discuss ways to combat this major global health problem.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I must also compliment the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease for providing technical assistance to the Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) and the NSP. I would also like to appreciate it for bringing together key stakeholders from health, Government, the private sector, civil society and media for promoting the campaign- ‘Call to Action for TB Free India’ India. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dear sisters and brothers,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India has achieved considerable progress on various health indicators with successive governments according to high priority to health and the wellbeing of the people. The average life expectancy has increased to 69 years and many infectious diseases have also been successfully eliminated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">But the spread of non-communicable diseases, rising healthcare costs, lack of adequate medical facilities in rural areas and other factors such as pollution are posing new and formidable challenges. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">According to data released by WHO in 2017, about 61 per cent of deaths in India are attributed to non-communicable diseases, including heart disorders, cancer and diabetes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">There is a need to establish NCD clinics in both urban and rural areas and the private sector must play a prominent role in setting up such clinics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Another area of concern that needs to be addressed is the shortage of qualified doctors and trained para-medical personnel in the country. It has been estimated that India was facing a shortage of 600,000 doctors and two million nurses. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I feel that Public Private Partnership could be the model to bridge the gap in providing technically advanced primary and secondary healthcare centres.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Making available advanced treatment at an affordable cost to all sections is another aspect that needs the attention of all the stakeholders in the health sector. It should be a matter of concern that each year several people are getting pushed into the vicious cycle of debts due to out-of-pocket expenses and high treatment costs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">With non-communicable diseases like cancer, diabetes and heart attack accounting for huge spending by households, this problem can be surmounted to a large extent by ensuring Universal Health Coverage where every individual gets quality treatment without facing any financial hardship. This is also essential to achieve Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I am glad that the Union Government has launched AayushmanBharath to provide comprehensive insurance coverage to 10 crore poor and vulnerable families. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Telangana is a dynamic and growing hub for innovative medical science and biomedical industry. I call upon the business leaders to play a more pro-active role in supporting Research and Development in treatment, care and prevention of TB. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I must also compliment the Hyderabad City Police and the Telangana government for launching ‘Smokefree Hyderabad’ campaign in the run-up to this conference. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I  hope that this conference will provide continuing momentum in the drive to eliminate TB both in India and worldwide. This is a global emergency and we must all work together and learn from each other to achieve our ambitious goals to end the scourge of TB and lung disease</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">JAI HIND!”</p>
