<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:black">Let me conclude with a statement made by a famous Indian poet Mammata. When he was asked as to why he wrote poetry, he said, “I write for earning name and becoming famous. I write to earn my living. But, above all this, I write because I believe I can change the ways of the world by reducing negativity and whatever is not good for humanity.”</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:black">I do hope that larger public good will serve as the underlying, unseen but undiminished source of inspiration as you continue to weave the silken threads of poetry and enthrall as well enlighten multitudes of people across the world.
