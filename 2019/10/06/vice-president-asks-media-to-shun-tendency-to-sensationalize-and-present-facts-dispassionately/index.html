Venkaiah Naidu today asked media to shun the tendency to sensationalize and present facts dispassionately without mixing news and views. He said that media must remain honest and truthful and act with great restraint and responsibility.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Speaking at the centennial celebrations of ‘the Samaja’, a leading Odia Daily,in Cuttack, Odisha today, he said that a free and fair media was not just a part of a healthy democracy but was an indispensable prerequisite. “Media has been considered the fourth pillar of the democratic system&#8211; a pillar that supports, nurtures and nourishes the democracy and helps in course corrections as and when necessary”, he added.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Stating that media must inform, educate and enlighten people, Shri Naidu said that it has a critical role to play in the formation of public opinion. He asserted that media must empower citizens and help in ushering in greater transparency and accountability in the governance system. “Media must amplify the voice of citizens and communicate their opinions to lawmakers”, he added.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">The Vice President asked media to get rid of established prejudices and give voice to the expectations of youth, women, farmers and entrepreneurs. “Media must act as the moral compass and the conscience of the society and must aggressively campaign to end all social evils. It must become the voice of the voiceless and help the helpless”, he added.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Underscoring that media had the potential to be a vehicle for change in status quo, he called for the reporting and highlighting of more positive stories and best practices to inspire positive changes.

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Speaking of the rapidly proliferating social media, a by-product of which is fake news, the Vice President expressed concern that the pervasive menace of fake news threatens to destroy the credibility of media and asked media to effectively tackle and disprove fake news by taking control of the narrative. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong><span style="color:#222222">The following is the full text of the speech:</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">I am very happy to be here today with all of you at the centennial celebrations of ‘the Samaja’, the premier Odia Daily.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">At the outset, let me extend my heartiest congratulations to the Samaja family on this momentous occasion.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Completion of 100 years is a significant milestone in the journey of an organization. It is a testimony to your commitment to journalistic excellence, your dedication to objective reporting and above all, the popularity you enjoy among the people of Odisha.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">I am told that the Samaja took birth in 1919 as a weekly newspaper from Satyabadi in Puri district, with the vision of informing, educating and empowering the people of Odisha and facilitating the development of the state and the nation.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">I am glad to note that the Samaja has remained the nerve centre of journalism, intellectual pursuit and social service in Odisha since its inception a century ago.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">I believe that Samaja is also considered to be the gold standard for Odia language and is a true delight to the literati of the state, so much so that, the elders of Odisha encourage their children to read the Samaja to perfect Odia language.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">I also applaud the Samaja for transcending its journalistic mandate and engaging in the service of the poor and the oppressed. I am happy to know that a major portion of its revenue is used for the welfare of people hit by calamities. It is indeed an example worth emulating. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">The illustrious founder of the Samaja, Utkalamani Pandit Gopabandhu Das, was a great teacher, a renaissance poet, a prolific writer, a seasoned journalist, a selfless social worker, an erudite legislator, a frontline freedom fighter and of course, a great proponent of Gandhian ideologies and moral values .</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">He was also a dedicated educationist. He constantly spoke of the need for all citizens to fulfill their ‘Fundamental Duties’. I am glad to note that he was also a firm believer of the ancient India ideal of <em>‘Vasudheyva Kutumbakam’</em> and dedicated his life to the service of his countrymen.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">I am also delighted to have released the book on Gopabandhu Das written by Dr. Subhash Chandra Mishra today. I hope that this book will take the life story of the great icon to the younger generation and serve as an inspiration.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">I appreciate the Samaja for building a towering edifice of outstanding journalism on the strong foundation of morals, values and ethics, laid by its visionary founder.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">My dear sisters and brothers,</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">The press in India has a long and illustrious history ever since the first newspaper, ‘Bengal Gazette’ was published by James Augustus Hickey in 1780.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">The press played a pivotal role in inspiring people and in voicing their aspirations when the struggle to gain independence from the British began gathering<strong> </strong>momentum. It acted as a great unifier, bringing people from different backgrounds together to fight for the noble cause of freedom.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">The press remained undaunted by the ironclad restrictions imposed by the British. The same resolute spirit continues to be the hallmark of the Indian media ever since independence, barring a temporary deviation during the dark times of the Emergency.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Today, India’s vibrant media landscape is dotted with thousands of journals and newspapers, hundreds of TV channels and scores of radio stations. Of course, you also have social media, which has become one of the main drivers of information in the Digital Age.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">My dear sisters and brothers,</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Democracy is a government of the people, for the people and by the people. It gives equal chance to all the citizens to participate and play a significant role in the political process and guarantees certain inalienable rights and freedoms to people.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">A democratic system will succeed only if there is extensive participation of its citizens in governance process.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">This participation will be a meaningful one only if citizens are well informed and educated. Access to information is essential for a democratic society because it ensures that citizens make responsible, informed choices rather than act out of ignorance or misinformation.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Thus reliable sources of information form an important constituent of a democratic society.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">This is where the role and importance of media lies.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Media must inform, educate and enlighten people. It has a critical role to play in the formation of public opinion. It must empower citizens and help in ushering in greater transparency and accountability in the governance system. It must amplify the voice of citizens and communicate their opinions to lawmakers</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Media also plays a crucial role in ensuring good governance in a democracy. Support of media may yield results in governance activities, particularly those related to decentralization, anti-corruption, and citizen participation in the policy process.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Free and fair elections conducted through transparent processes require a media sector which gives candidates equal access, and reports the relevant issues in a timely, objective manner.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Media must also expose loopholes in the democratic system, which ultimately helps government in filling the vacuums and gaps, making the system more accountable, responsive and citizen-friendly.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">A democracy without media is akin to a vehicle without any wheels.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">A free and fair media is not just a part of a healthy democracy but is an indispensable prerequisite. Media has been considered the fourth pillar of the democratic system&#8211; a pillar that supports, nurtures and nourishes the democracy and helps in course corrections as and when necessary. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Although freedom of the press has not been overtly recognized as a fundamental right in our Constitution – a perusal of the extensive debates of the Constituent Assembly makes it abundantly clear that there was wide ranging consensus about considering media freedom as an extension of fundamental freedom of expression.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">After that, several decisions of the Supreme Court gave legitimacy to this recognition. Mahatma Gandhi once said that “freedom of the press is precious privilege that no country can forego”.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">My dear sisters and brothers,</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Media is a national resource that the journalists use in public trust.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Mahatma Gandhi once said that it is the duty of a journalist to realize the public opinion of the country and give it a vocal expression boldly.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">In view of the tremendous responsibility it holds, media must remain honest and truthful and act with great restraint, responsibility, placing the welfare of the common man and the progress of the nation at the centre of all its activities.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Mahatma Gandhi also said that the objective of journalism should only be social service.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Journalism is a mission.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">TRPs, circulation figures and bottom lines, though important, must not dictate your path.

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">It must get rid of established prejudices and give voice to the expectations of youth, women, farmers and entrepreneurs. Media must act as the moral compass and the conscience of the society and must aggressively campaign to end all social evils. You must become the voice of the voiceless and help the helpless.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Media must be a vehicle for change in status quo.

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Media must play a constructive role in solving the burning problems of our time&#8211; from poverty to disease to climate change.

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has announced on October 2<sup>nd</sup>, on the occasion of the 150<sup>th</sup> birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi that India was Open Defecation Free and a lot of credit for this achievement goes to the media.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">It must now take up more such missions in national interest, such as ‘Fit India’ and turn them into people’s movements. Media must also lend a hand in protecting, preserving and promoting India’s rich cultural heritage and languages.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">We live in an era of rapidly proliferating social media, a by-product of which is fake news. The pervasive menace of fake news now threatens to destroy the credibility of media.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Under such circumstances, you must be prepared to effectively tackle and disprove fake news by taking control of the narrative. You must devise creative solutions to contain fake news. You must tackle paid news with the same zeal too.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">My dear sisters and brothers,</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">I hope that more and more vernacular newspapers would come up in India, promoting regional languages and spearheading the prosperity of rural areas.</span></span></span></span></p>
