<p>The air quality in the National Capital dips to ‘very poor’ as the residents complain about difficulty in breathing and of burning sensation in the eyes on Monday morning after Diwali. Adding to the pollution, roads in several areas of Delhi were littered with cracker waste.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the Air Quality Index (AQI) recorded earlier today the major pollutant levels were in the ‘severe category’ in Lodhi Road area.</p>



<p>With an aim to curb the menace of pollution the East Delhi Muncipal Corporation (EDMC) on Monday began sprinkling water on the roads in Laxmi Nagar area. The local authorities were seen running the machines in and around the area.</p>



<p>The Arvind Kejriwal-led government has announced the implementation of Odd-Even scheme from November 4 to 15 2019, stating that smog from nearby states due to burning of crop residue is one of the major causes of pollution in the region.</p>
