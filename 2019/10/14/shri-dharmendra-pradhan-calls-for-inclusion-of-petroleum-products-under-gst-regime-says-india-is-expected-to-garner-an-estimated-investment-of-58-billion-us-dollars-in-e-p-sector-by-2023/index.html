Mixing all commerciallyviable energy sources is the only feasible way forward in our context. India will chart its own course of energy transition in a responsible manner.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left:7.1pt; margin-right:7.85pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">The Minister highlighted several measures taken by the Government to overhaul the hydrocarbon policy framework to revitalize oil and gas ecosystem and establish a conducive business environment. Growing presence of global oil and gas majors like Saudi Aramco, ADNOC, BP, Shell, Total, Rosneft and ExxonMobil in India is a testimony to the faith and confidence of global investors on promising India’s growth story. He said “I am glad to see investors, MakinginIndia, for India, and also for the globe.”</span></p>
<p style="margin-left:7.1pt; margin-right:8.15pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px"> Shri Pradhan said that we have successfully completed three bid rounds under Open Acreage Licensing Policy and two rounds of bidding under the Discovered Small Fields (DSF) policy. Through these successful biddings, India is expected to garner an estimated investment of 58 billion US dollars in E &amp; P sector by 2023. He said that Special thrust is being given to promote gas based economy under the guidance of Hon’ble Prime Minister Modi. “Iamhappytoinformyouthataswespeak, an estimated investment of 60 billion US dollars is lined up in building gaspipelines, terminals, and City Gas infrastructure that are in different stages ofimplementation.”, he added. The City Gas Distribution network development in India which hasbeen authorized for building and commissioning will cover half of India’s geography and would serve 70%of India’s population through availability of low carbon and affordable natural gas.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left:7.1pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">The Minister expressed the Government’s commitment to make India a low carbon economy, though our per capita carbon emission is far less than the world average particularly the OECD countries. Regarding the downstream sector, he said that ithasbeen completely liberalized. Market driven pricing of major petroleum products reflects the changes in line with the international price of crude oil. “Our fuel standards are comparable to the best in world and pan India BS-VI complaint fuel will be available in India from 1 April2020.”, Shri Pradhan said. </span></p>
<p style="margin-left:7.1pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">To promote the energy sustainability, the Minister said that we are giving thrust on biofuels. The new National Biofuel policy envisages an integrated approach to produce biofuels from various types of agriculture residue and municipal solid waste. Biofuel policy will help farmers to become “urjadata from anndata”.An important initiative has been undertaken to produce compressed biogas from biomass waste. We have made a target to setup 5000 compressed biogas plants in different parts of the country. These plants are being setup by private entrepreneurs. Oil marketing companies are offering assured price and offtake guarantee to procure the compressed biogas. Highlighting some difficulties being faced by these private entrepreneurs to access to bank finance for setting up CBG plants, he requested Finance Minister to look into this challenge. The Minister said that We also aim to achieve 10% blending percentage of ethanol in petrol by 2022 to cut dependence on energy import, promote the use of environment-friendly fuel and boost the agriculture sector.We are accelerating conversion of Used Cooking Oil (UCO) to biodiesel across 100 cities in India.</span></p>
