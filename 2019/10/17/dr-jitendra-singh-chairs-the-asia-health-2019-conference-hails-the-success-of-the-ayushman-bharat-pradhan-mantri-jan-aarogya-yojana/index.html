The diseases which were unheard in India in the past have become very much prevalent now a days  like heart disease or diabetes etc. Some of the diseases which were confined to some areas or States only are no longer limited to that area, the socio-cultural milieu does not determined the data on health care, therefore need to work on data collection is essential, he added. </span></span></p>
