Today, had a day-long visit of Sakhalin field and processing facilities.

It is a prolific oil producing field like Bombay High. Exxon Mobil, Rosneft, Japanese SODECO and ONGC Videsh are the partners in this field which will continue to produce oil and gas till 2055. Shri Pradhan visited the Rig “Krechet” which is the biggest and most powerful land rig in the world. It is a covered rig to allow people to work in extreme temperature (-40 degree Celsius in winter)-  it drills up to 14 KM in horizontal drilling.</p>
