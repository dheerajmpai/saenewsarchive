<p style="text-align:justify">Speaking on the occasion Dr Jitendra Singh said that this is a unique moment for the country. 66 years ago, Dr Mukherjee was arrested illegally from Lakhanpur, and was taken to Srinagar through Chenani Nashari. Dr Mukherjee was a sitting member of Lok Sabha at that time. The naming of this tunnel after Dr Syama Prasad Mukherjee is a tribute to him and coming generations will remember this day in future, said the Minister. He said this is a tribute to the struggle of workers, and redeems Dr Mookerjee’s pledge of ‘Ek Vidhaan, Ek Nishaan, Ek Pradhan.’  He added that the region has seen a lot of development under the Narendra Modi led Government. About 2 dozen bridges have been constructed in Udhampur. There are inter-state bridges and state of the art tunnels, he added.</p>
