The second edition of bilateral annual military exercise Dharma Guardian &#8211; 2019 between Indian and Japanese Army culminated on 31 October 2019 at Counter Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School (CIJWS) Vairengte, Mizoram in a function presided over by General Goro Yuasa, Chief of Staff, Japanense Ground Self Defence Forces and Lieutenant General Rajeev Sirohi, GOC, 3 Corps.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The primary focus of the exercise was to train and equip the contingents in counter insurgency and counter-terrorism operations in mountainous terrain. The entire curriculum was planned in a progressive manner wherein the participants initially familiarised with each others&#8217; organisation, weapons and combat skills before graduating to joint tactical exercises.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As part of the exercise, important lectures, demonstrations and drills related to counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations were conducted.
