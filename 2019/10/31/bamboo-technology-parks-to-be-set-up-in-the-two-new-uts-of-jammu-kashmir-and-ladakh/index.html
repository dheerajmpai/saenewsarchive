<p style="text-align:justify">The Minister said bamboo grows naturally in Kathua and neighbouring Himalayan foothill districts adjoining Punjab. He said there is huge potential to commercially exploit bamboo farming in this region. “The bamboo model will be replicated in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh for bamboo cultivation, harvesting and application,” Dr Jitendra Singh said. “Besides, considering the success of the National Bamboo Mission (NBM), this model will be replicated in the two new UTs in other spheres of horticulture,” he added.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dr Jitendra Singh said the three Bamboo Parks are proposed to be established in Jammu, Srinagar and Leh. He said a team of high level officials of the DoNER Ministry recently visited the erstwhile state of J&#038;K and held wide-ranging talks with the local administration. Assuring that the Centre will allocate enough funds for the proposed three Bamboo Parks, he said funding will be shared by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs which directly administers the UTs, the Ministry of Agriculture which launched the NBM and the DoNER Ministry. “If required, I will discuss the allocation of funds with the Union Home Minister and Agriculture Minister for this purpose,” he said. The Guwahati based Cane and Bamboo Technology Centre (CBTC), functioning under the NEC, will implement the project, he added.</p>
