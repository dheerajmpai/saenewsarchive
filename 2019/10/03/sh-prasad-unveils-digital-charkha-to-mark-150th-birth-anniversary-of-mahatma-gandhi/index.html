Glittering in its tri-colour splendour, the Digital Charkha is an amalgamation of the traditional design with a digital spin. The wheel of the Charkha is made up of interlinked digital grids in place of fine threads thus portraying that the core of Digital India is embedded in Gandhian philosophy of equality</strong>, unity, corruption free and empowerment of ordinary citizens. This philosophy resonates with the Prime Minister’s vision for a <em>NEW DIGITAL INDIA </em>that<em> </em>promises to deliver e-Governance services as basic fundamental rights to each and every citizen of the country. </span></span></p>
