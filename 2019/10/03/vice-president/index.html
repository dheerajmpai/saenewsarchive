He said one must accord full respect to all the mother tongues or native languages. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",Times,serif; font-size:18px'>Stating that knowing many languages was an advantage, especially in a country like India which was home to rich linguistic diversity, the Vice President asserted that there should not be imposition of any language, nor should there be opposition to any language.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",Times,serif; font-size:18px'>Describing Hyderabad as the confluence of cultures and languages, Shri Naidu said that the city played an important role in the promotion, spread, and development of Hindi, Urdu along with Telugu.

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",Times,serif; font-size:18px'>The Vice President also suggested that a handbook or dictionary of simplified Hindi words should be published as it would be beneficial for MPs, especially from the non-Hindi speaking States.

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",Times,serif; font-size:18px'>Soon after assuming that charge of Rajya Sabha Chairman, Shri Naidu had suggested that the Samithi must meet twice a year and one meeting should be held in the non-Hindi speaking region. Today’s Hyderabad meeting was the first in that series.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",Times,serif; font-size:18px'>The Vice President hoped that the meeting of the Rajbhasha Samiti held in Hyderabad would help in promoting the use of Hindi in South India and other states of the country and assist in increasing the dialogue between languages and enrich their vocabulary and literature.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",Times,serif; font-size:18px'>Referring to the inspiration of Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi in the promotion of Hindi, the Vice President said that Gandhiji established the Dakshin Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha in Madras in 1918.
