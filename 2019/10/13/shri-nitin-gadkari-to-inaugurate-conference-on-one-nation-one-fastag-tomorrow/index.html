<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:-30.65pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">The conference will see the signing of MoUs with state departments / other agencies for bringing in a unified electronic tolling solution across the country. This would mean enabling the use of the same FASTag affixed on the windscreen of a vehicle at every   toll plaza in the country under jurisdiction of different states /agencies and other entities. This will help provide seamless services to consumers across the country.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:-30.65pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Another MoU will be signed tomorrow, between the Indian Highways Management Company Ltd. (IHMCL) and Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) for integration of FASTag with GST E- Way Bill System. The GST Council has already accorded ‘in-principle’ approval for this integration. The integration of EWB system with FASTag will help revenue authorities track the movement of vehicles and ensure that they are travelling to the same destination that the transporter or the trader had specified while generating the e-way bill.</span></span></p>
