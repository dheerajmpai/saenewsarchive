It came into being on March 28, 1888 with the arrival of first batch of 10 qualified British Nurses in Bombay (now Mumbai), to organise nursing in Military hospitals in India.  In 1893 it was designated as Indian Army Nursing Service (IANS) and in 1902 as Queen Alexandra Military Nursing Service (QAMNS). In 1914 for the first time Nurses were enrolled in India and were attached to QAMNS.</span></span></span></p>

On September 15, 1943, the IMNS officers became a part of the Indian Army and the members of service became Commissioned Officers. The organisation is headed at the Army Headquarters by ADG MNS at the Rank of Maj General and at command level by Brigadier MNS in the rank of Brigadier.</span></span></span></p>
