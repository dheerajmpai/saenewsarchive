<p style="text-align:justify">The introduction of GST is a game changer for Indian economy as it has replaced multi-layered, complex indirect tax structure with a simple, transparent and technology–driven tax regime. It has integrated India into a single, common market by breaking barriers to inter-State trade and commerce. By eliminating cascading of taxes and reducing transaction costs, it will enhance ease of doing business and provide an impetus to ‘Make in India’ campaign.</p>
