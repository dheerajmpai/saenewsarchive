The Chief of the Malagasy Navy, Rear Admiral Vaohavy Andasy also addressed the delegates.

<p style="text-align:justify">In the course of two days, the MISW aims to acquaint participants about IFC-IOR and its information sharing mechanisms and promote sharing of best practices in this field. This aims to yield better response to the myriad security and safety challenges that IOR faces. Towards this, participants would be exposed to issues such as maritime terrorism, piracy, human and drug trafficking, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief; and the legal perspective of combating these challenges. The delegates would also participate in an information sharing exercise on 13 Jun 19 to practice and validate some of the concepts and procedures that have been evolved during the workshop.</p>
