<p style="text-align:justify">Background:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had come across certain arbitrary action by MCI in disregard to the provisions of the IMC Act, 1956 and regulations made thereunder. Further, the Oversight Committee constituted by the Hon&#8217;ble Supreme Court to oversee the functioning of MCI had also cited instances of non-compliance of their instructions and subsequently, all members of the Oversight Committee tendered their resignation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In view of these developments, and to put an alternative mechanism in place of MCI so as to bring transparency, accountability and quality in the governance of medical education in the country, it was decided to supersede the MCI through the Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018 promulgated on 26.09.2018 and entrust its affairs to a Board of Governors (BoG) consisting of eminent doctors. The BoG was constituted under the Chairmanship of Dr. V.K. Paul, Member NITI Aayog and comprising six other members.</p>

However, despite all efforts, during the winter session 2018 of Parliament the Bill could not be taken up for consideration and passing in the Rajya Sabha and the House has been adjourned sine die on Wednesday, the 9th January, 2019.
