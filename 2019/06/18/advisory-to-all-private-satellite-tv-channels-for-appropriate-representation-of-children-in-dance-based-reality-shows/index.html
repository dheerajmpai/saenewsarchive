These moves are often suggestive and age-inappropriate. Such acts may also have distressing impact on children, impacting them at a young and impressionable age.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">All private satellite TV Channels are expected to abide by the provisions contained in Programme &#038; Advertising Codes prescribed under the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995 and rules framed. As per the rules, no programme should be carried on TV which denigrates children, and further that programmes meant for children should not contain any bad language or explicit scenes of violence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Ministry has accordingly issued an Advisory to all private satellite TV channels to avoid showing children in indecent, suggestive and inappropriate manner in dance reality shows or other such programmes. The channels have been further advised to exercise maximum restraint, sensitivity and caution while showing such  reality shows and programmes.</p>
