<p style="text-align:justify">Most of these components will be open to all 43 ULBs in the state who may wish to participate within an agreed framework under the project. Over 350,000 urban residents of the participating ULBs are expected to benefit, of which at least 45 percent will be women. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Interventions such as piped water supply, storm water drains, climate friendly road construction and energy efficient street lighting will not only help improve urban services but also make it environmentally sustainable. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“Jharkhand needs large-scale investments in urban infrastructure and services. Such investments will require a phased approach. This project will focus on closing the gap on access to basic services and at the same time build the capacity of its institutions to better manage and provide services effectively,” said MsVasudhaThawakar , Senior Urban Development Specialist and Task Team Leader for the project. </p>
