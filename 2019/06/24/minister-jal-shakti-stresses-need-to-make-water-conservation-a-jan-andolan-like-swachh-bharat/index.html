<p style="text-align:justify">The Minister said, “Years before today, nobody would have believed that the sanitation coverage of India would reach the 100% mark by 2019. Today, in just 4 and a half years since the launch of the Swachh Bharat Mission, this figure has increased from 39% to 99%.  I express my gratitude to all of you who have contributed to this jan andolan and have made India a role model for the rest of the world.”</p>
