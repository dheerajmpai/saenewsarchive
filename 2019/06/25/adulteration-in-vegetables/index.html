<p style="text-align:justify">Instances of sale/supply of sub-standard and adulterated food items, use of excess chemicals, artificial colouring of vegetables, presence of pesticides/insecticides residues in fruits and vegetables beyond prescribed MRLs etc. are detected during the enforcement activities undertaken by the State/UT Governments . Such instances have also been reported to FSSAI through various other channels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">To check adulteration in vegetable items and in other food products, State/UT Governments regularly conduct surveillance and enforcement drives and conduct regular surveillance, monitoring, inspection and random sampling of food products to check that they comply with the standards laid down under Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, and the rules and regulations made thereunder. In cases where the food samples are found to be non-conforming, recourse is taken to penal provisions under Chapter IX of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.</p>
