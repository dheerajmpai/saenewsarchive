<p style="text-align:justify">As per RBI data on global operations, aggregate gross advances of PSBs increased from       Rs. 18,19,074 crore as on 31.3.2008 to Rs. 52,15,920 crore as on 31.3.2014. As per RBI inputs, the primary reasons for spurt in Stressed Assets have been observed to be, inter-alia, aggressive lending practices, wilful default/loan frauds/corruption in some cases, and economic slowdown. Asset Quality Review (AQR) initiated in 2015 for clean and fully provisioned bank balance-sheets revealed high incidence of Non-Performing Assets (NPAs). As a result of AQR and subsequent transparent recognition by banks, stressed accounts were reclassified as NPAs and expected losses on stressed loans, not provided for earlier under flexibility given to restructured loans, were provided for. Further, all such schemes for restructuring stressed loans were withdrawn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Government adopted the comprehensive 4R’s strategy consisting of recognition of NPAs transparently, resolution and recovering value from stressed accounts, recapitalising Public Sector Banks (PSBs), and reforms in PSBs and financial ecosystem to ensure a responsible and clean system. Steps taken under these strategies to expedite and enable resolution of NPAs of PSBs, and to improve the condition of banks include, inter-alia, the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">            Positive impact on PSBs of Government’s 4R’s approach is now visible and includes, inter-alia¸ the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">By addressing the underlying causes behind the build-up of stress in PSBs through comprehensive reform to change credit culture and tighten discipline for every stakeholder in the financial system, institutionalising robust underwriting and monitoring, governance reforms, and leverage the transformation potential of technology, the risk of recurrence of excessive stress in PSBs has been minimised and PSBs have emerged stronger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As per inputs received from RBI, the share of lending by PSBs and Private Sector Banks to real estate sector as a percentage of total lending has increased from 16.77% in 2013 to 17.57% in 2016. Further, their total advances to the real estate sector rose from   Rs. 8,55,695 crore in 2013 to Rs. 12,11,889 crore in 2016.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Note: Figures cited above for PSBs include those for IDBI Bank Limited, which was re-categorised as A Private Sector Bank by RBI with effect from 21.1.2019.</p>
