The benchmark for initiating relief measures by banks has also been reduced from 50% to 33% crop loss in line with the National Disaster Management Framework. Banks have also been advised not to insist for additional collateral security for restructured loans.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">With a view to ensuring availability of agriculture credit at a reduced interest rate, the Government of India in the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers’ Welfare (DAC&#038;FW) implements an interest subvention scheme for short term crop loans up to Rs. 3.00 lakh, which provides interest subvention of 2% per annum to Banks on use of their own resources, and,  an additional 3% incentive to the farmers for prompt repayment of the loan, thereby reducing the effective rate of interest to 4%. Under the aforesaid interest subvention scheme, to provide relief to farmers affected by natural calamities, the interest subvention (2%) on crop loan continues to be available to banks for the first year on the restructured amount. Such restructured loans may however, attract normal rate of interest from the second year onwards as per policy laid down by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In order to provide relief to the farmers affected due to severe natural calamities, the Government in DAC&#038;FW has decided that interest subvention of 2% per annum will be made available to banks for first three years/entire period (subject to a maximum of five years) on the restructured loan amount, and in all such cases the benefit of prompt repayment incentive at 3% per annum shall also be provided to the affected farmers. The grant of such benefits in cases of severe natural calamities shall, however, be decided by a High Level Committee (HLC) based on the recommendation of Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) and Sub Committee of National Executive Committee (SC-NEC).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC), Uttar Pradesh has reported that there was no natural calamity in the State of Uttar Pradesh during Financial Year 2018-19 and therefore no State Government notification was issued in this regard. </p>
