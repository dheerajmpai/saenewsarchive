<p style="text-align:justify"> The facilities provided to farmers in e-NAM mandis are continuously reviewed by the Government.   The   feedback   on the   various   facilities,  such as, quality assaying, e-trading, e-payment etc. is provided to States to improve their functioning. As an outcome of the continuous review, the facilities such as inter-mandi trade, inter-state trade, quality assaying, number of commodities on e-NAM, e-trading, e-payment etc. have improved. The number of farmers and buyers registered on e-NAM platform have been continuously increasing. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Three reforms are mandatory for States/Union Territories (UTs) in their respective State Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Acts for integrating their mandis with National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) platform i.e. (i) Provision for e-trading, (ii) Single point levy of market fee, (iii) Unified Single trading license for the State. States without APMC Act like Bihar need to provide legally enforceable guidelines and institutional mechanism for implementing e-NAM. Based on the proposals received from the compliant States/Union Territories (UTs), mandis are considered for integration by Government of India  with e-NAM platform. However, Government of Bihar has not proposed any of their market for integration with e-NAM platform. Number of farmers who have sold their produce on e-NAM platform in Madhya Pradesh is 10,80,704.</p>
