In this regard, for advancement of Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) of the society, and in accordance with the Constitution 103rd Amendment Act 2019, this Ministry has issued instructions providing 10 percent reservation to EWS categories for admission in Central Educational Institutions (CEIs). This reservation for EWS categories would be provided without disturbing the existing entitlements for SC/ST and OBC categories.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The above reservation is being provided from the academic year 2019-20 onwards in Central Educational Institutions, and would help in creating more than 2 lakh additional seats.  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 provides for free and compulsory education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years. The Act requires all private schools to reserve 25% of seats to children from poor families.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Further, Samagra Shiksha &#8211; an Integrated Centrally Sponsored Scheme for School Education has been launched throughout the country, as on overarching programme for the school education sector extending from pre-school to class XII. This scheme aims towards ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels of school education. This programme subsumes the three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE) and provides for universal access and retention, bridging of gender and social category gaps in education and enhancement of learning level of children at all levels of school education.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In the Indian Institute of Technology (IITs), subsidy is provided to the students enrolled for Under Graduate programmes. Full fee waiver is provided in respect of Scheduled Castes /Scheduled Tribes /Physically Handicapped students and most economically backward students whose family income is less than Rs.1 lakh per annum; and two third fee remission to other economically backward students whose family income is between Rs.1 lakh to 5 lakh per annum.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Ministry of Human Resource Development is implementing the Central Sector Interest Subsidy Scheme for welfare of the students from rural areas with poor economic backgrounds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The scheme aims to ensure that no one from the Economically Weaker Sections, including minorities, SCs/STs, women and disabled, is denied access to professional education only for the reason that he or she is poor. Under the Scheme, full interest subsidy is provided during the moratorium period (course period plus one year), on the educational loan up to Rs. 7.5 lakh, taken by the students having annual parental income up to Rs.4.5 lakh. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Government is regularly monitoring the creation of seats for EWS categories in the CEIs. In order to prevent commercialization of education and protect the interests of the poor students the UGC (Institution of Eminence Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2017 have been notified.</p>
