An Air India Specific Alternative Mechanism (AISAM) was constituted by CCEA for this. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In an AISAM Meeting held on 28th March 2018, which is last year, it was decided that due to issues like volatile crude oil prices &#038; adverse fluctuations in exchange rates, the atmosphere was not conducive for the disinvestment. But this was last year. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">However, continued support from the govt had resulted in improvement of financial &#038; operational performance of Air India. As per the recommendations of AISAM, the govt will now go ahead with the process of disinvestment of the company.</p>
