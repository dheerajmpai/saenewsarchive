To make availability widespread and maximizing existing vehicles to affix FASTags, Government has made it mandatory to affix FASTag for issuance of National Permit (N/P). A wide number of banks (22 numbers) have been certified to issue FASTag across the country. Further, bank neutral FASTag “NHAI FASTag” have been launched for easy availability at petrol-pump and on e-commerce site Amazon. By adopting these measures, Government endeavours to increase penetration of FASTag substantially and moving towards 100% cashless.</p>
