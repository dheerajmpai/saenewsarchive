I look forward to discussing the major challenges and opportunities faced by our world today with other global leaders. Women Empowerment, issues related to digitalization and artificial intelligence, and progress in achieving SDGs and in our common efforts to address major global challenges such as terrorism and climate change form the rich agenda of the Summit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Summit will provide an important opportunity to reiterate and reinforce our strong support to reformed multilateralism, which is crucial for preserving rule-based international order in today’s fast changing world. The Summit will also be a platform for sharing India’s strong developmental experience of the last five years, which provided the basis for a resounding mandate by the people of India to the Government to continue on the path to progress and stability.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Osaka Summit will also be an important stepping stone for India towards hosting the G-20 Summit in 2022, when we usher in a New India in the 75th Anniversary year of our Independence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">On the sidelines, I also look forward to engaging with leaders of our major partner countries on important issues of bilateral and global importance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I also look forward to host the next Russia, India and China (RIC) Informal Summit on the sidelines, and also to participate in the next informal meetings of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and JAI (Japan, America and India) leaders</p>
