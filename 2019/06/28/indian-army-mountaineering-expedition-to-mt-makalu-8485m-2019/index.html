The Indian Army Mountaineering team achieved a singular distinction by placing sixteen members on the summit of Mt Makalu, the fifth highest peak of the world, on 16 May 2019. Indian Army has now climbed all eight-thousander peaks in Nepal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The team led by Major Manoj Joshi was ‘Flagged Off’ by Director General of Military Training on 26 March 2019 at New Delhi. A highly experienced and balanced team was shortlisted and trained for the expedition which required sheer determination, team spirit and logistic support. The team experienced many difficulties and challenges en-route wherein they fought against nature’s fury, negotiated deep crevasses, withstood now blizzards and climbed near vertical rocks and ice walls but the sheer determination of the valiant climbers and the cohesive team effort brought laurels for the Army and the Nation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The expedition has shown that given an opportunity, Army team is capable of reaching any height in any terrain under any circumstances. </p>
