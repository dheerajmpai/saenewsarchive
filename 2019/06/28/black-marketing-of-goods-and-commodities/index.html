The Essential Commodities Act (EC Act), 1955 and the Prevention of Blackmarketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act, (PBMMSEC Act), 1980 provide the legislative and administrative foundation to control hoarding and blackmarketing of essential commodities. Powers to control hoarding, blackmarketing etc. under these Acts have been delegated to States/ UTs. State/UT Governments are advised/sensitised from time to time to take appropriate action against hoarding &#038; blackmarketing and enforce the two Acts, effectively.</p>
