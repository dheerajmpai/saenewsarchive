Post Green Revolution, there is increase in the use of chemical fertilizers and irrigation water to meet the nutrients and water demand respectively, of high yielding varieties (HYVs) of crops. However, due to imbalanced use of fertilizers coupled with decrease  in use of organic manure and over exploitation of ground water, there is deterioration of natural resources.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In order to meet the foodgrains requirement of the growing population of the country, the Government of India is laying emphasis on development of resource rich eastern region of the country for enhancing agricultural production. This would also help in reducing the over exploitation of natural resources in north western region, the traditional food bowl of the country. Considering potentiality of increasing production and productivity of foodgrains in eastern states, “Bringing Green Revolution to Eastern India (BGREI)”- a sub scheme of Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) is being implemented since 2010-11 in seven (7) eastern states of the country namely Assam, Bihar, Chhatisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Eastern Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. After implementation of the programme, the production of rice has increased in seven eastern states from 45.65 million tonnes during 2009-10 to 57.18 million tonnes during 2017-18.      </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Besides, the Schemes/Missions namely, National Food Security Mission (NFSM), Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA), Sub-Mission on Seeds and Planting Material (SMSP), Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanisation (SMAM) etc. under the Umbrella scheme, “Green Revolution– Krishonnati Yojana” are also continued beyond 12th Five Year Plan for the periods from 2017-18 to 2019-20.  These schemes are for the development of the agriculture and allied sector in a holistic and scientific manner to increase the income of farmers by enhancing production, productivity and better returns on produce.</p>
