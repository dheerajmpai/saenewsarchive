<p style="text-align:justify">Under PMKVY 2016-20, focus on employment has been significantly enhanced and candidates have been placed in various sectors and industries. Training Centers (TCs)/ Training Providers (TPs) are required to have dedicated mentorship-cum-placement cells for industry linkage and placement of candidates. TPs are mandated to organize Placement/Rozgar Melas every six months with support from the Sector Skill Councils (SSCs) and to ensure the participation of local industry. Scheme also incentivizes TCs/TPs for facilitating placement of the trained candidates. Further, the reimbursement of last 20% of training payout to TCs is linked with the placement (wage employment or self employment) of the candidate. Additionally, post placement support of Rs. 1500 per month per trainee is applicable for special group (women candidates and persons with disability) and special areas (LWE, North East region and J&#038;K) for 2 or 3 month post training depending on placement within or outside the district of the domicile of the candidate.</p>
