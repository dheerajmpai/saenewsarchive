<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As on date, there is no Central regulatory body for allied health professions. However few States are reported to have statutory mechanism for regulation of allied and healthcare related professions (Paramedical Council or State Physiotherapy or Occupational Therapy Council etc.).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Allied and Healthcare Professions Bill, 2018 provides for regulation and maintenance of standards of education and services by allied &#038; healthcare professionals besides maintenance of Central Register of such professionals, who lack a comprehensive regulatory mechanism.</p>
