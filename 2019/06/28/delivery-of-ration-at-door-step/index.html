Further, in this regard no objection has been received from any State/UT by the Department.  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Public Distribution System (PDS) is operated under the joint responsibility of the Central and State/UT Governments. Central Govt. is responsible for procurement, allocation and transportation of foodgrains upto the designated depots of the FCI.  The operational responsibilities for identification of eligible beneficiaries/families, issuance of ration cards to them and maintenance of all record s relating to beneficiaries and distribution of foodgrains, etc. rest with the concerned State/UT Government.</p>
