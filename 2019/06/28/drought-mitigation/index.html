Progress of Monsoon and Area coverage etc. are monitored weekly through Weather Watch Group meetings as well as video conferencing, advising the States to take steps according to the prevailing situation. District Agriculture Contingency Plans for 648 districts have been prepared by Central Research Institute for Dry land Agriculture (CRIDA) to mitigate the situation in drought affected areas. There is a provision of distribution of seeds of contingency crops such as pulses, millets, oilseeds, which are drought hardy and survive with minimal available water in rain fed/ drought affected areas under National Food Security Mission (NFSM). States also have been made aware about the latest know how/ technology during National Conference on Kharif – 2019 (25-26 April, 2019). Agriculture is a State subject. Government of India supports and facilitates the State Governments through many Centrally Sponsored and Central Sector Schemes to promote agriculture in the country to boost farmer’s income through various schemes.  There is no such report from any State Government during the current Kharif 2019 season.</p>
