In sugar season 2017-18, cane dues payable in respect of Uttar Pradesh and on all India basis was Rs. 33013 crores and Rs. 82730 crores respectively. As a result of various measures enumerated in reply to part (c) of the question, the cane dues of farmers on all India basis for previous sugar season 2017-18 have been reduced to only Rs. 303 crores as on 24.06.2019. In respect of Uttar Pradesh the cane price dues have been reduced to only Rs. 49 crores for sugar season 2017-18.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Due to surplus sugar production, during the previous sugar season and the current sugar season, the sugar prices remained depressed which adversely affected the liquidity of the sugar mills resulting in accumulation of cane price arrears of the farmers.</p>
