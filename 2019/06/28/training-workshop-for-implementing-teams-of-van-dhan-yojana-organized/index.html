<p style="text-align:justify">The Minister emphasised that the Tribal groups are the rightful owners of the Minor Forest Produce (MFP) and we are only helping them claim their rightful value for the forest produce. The tribal groups are the guardians of some of the most important natural resources, like forest, rivers, and minerals, he said. Despite such invaluable efforts by the tribal community, they are still amongst the most deprived communities and it is the government’s duty to support them in their efforts. He advised the team to work with utmost passion for making an impact on the ground through successful implementation of the scheme.  Shri Arjun Munda emphasized on the importance of networking and collaborating with stakeholders from public and private sectors to ensure maximum outreach for the scheme.  He advised the team to work on the implementation roadmap with utmost accountability and as per timelines.</p>
