The world was shocked. The entire nation was in an intense grief. The victim&#8217;s families were shocked. But a bunch of miscreants, mostly journalists and Muslim students, started celebrating the terrorist act on Social Media. Some of them went upto the level of supporting the terrorist act. It has to be noted that Facebook and twitter has strict rules against promotion of terrorism. But in most of the cases Facebook and Twitter does not act against Islamic Terrorism. Even if it did it would be too late.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anshul Saxena and his team took a vigil and ensured the miscreants got what they deserved. He also ensured the miscreants posts did not reach the victim&#8217;s families. Ironically, He was banned from Facebook for this vigil.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Promoters of Terrorism :</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nidhi Sethi, Sub-editor of NDTV promotes terrorism: Suspended for mere two weeks</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Basim Hilal, student of Aligarh Muslim University: FIR Filed</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Aabid Malik (Relegion &#8211; Sunni). FIR filed</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Riyaz Ahmed Wani &#8211; Srinagar. Suspended</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Aysir Rashid &#8211; Suspended</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Iqbaal Khan &#8211; Suspended</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One has to notice that most of the terrorist promoters are from a particular religion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the hardwork by Anshul Saxena he was banned by Facebook</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
