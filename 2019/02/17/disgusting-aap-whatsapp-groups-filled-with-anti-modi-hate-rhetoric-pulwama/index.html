When the nation is supposed to stand united against the terrorism some of the Political parties have taken this to their political advantage. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Arvind Kejriwal&#8217;s Aam Aadmi supporters have pro-actively involved in making the best advantage out of the Pulwama Terrorist attack. Banned terrorist organization, Jaish-e-Mohammed, backed by Pakistan has claimed the responsibility for the attack. But it seems the AAP supporters believe it was an insider act by the Narendra Modi. Credit goes to the WhatsApp and Telegram groups</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Here are some snapshots :</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Translation: Modi will take the advantage of Army&#8217;s capability to come back to power</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Fake news against Modi was being spread in Aam Aadmi Party groups</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Translation : &#8220;Modi had information about the attack. He did not act intentionally&#8221;. &#8220;Modi never fought against terrorism. All he does is to enjoy Biryani in Pakistan&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Fake news against Narendra Modi was spread by Arvind Kejriwal&#8217;s Aam Aadmi Party group.The Image says : &#8220;Modi is not sad due to the attack&#8221;. &#8220;Modi knows how to play with emotions&#8221;. &#8220;Modi knew everything about the Attack in advance&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Aam Aadmi Party known for it&#8217;s notorious involvement is receiving foreign funds now has WhatsApp and Telegram groups all managed by foreign residents. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The WhatsApp group is generally flooded with fake news mostly derogating the Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Unlike normal WhatsApp discussion groups where everyone is allowed to send messages these groups are nothing but broadcasters. Only the admins are permitted to send messages while others can only read. This severely restricts people to raise voice against fake and hate news. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Note that Only Admins can send messages!Note that the groups foreign handlesThere are multiple such groups. AAP Live 1,2,3, and so on</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">While there are several allegations against the Pro-BJP, Pro-Indian WhatsApp groups sending fake messages. Most of the fake messages in Pro-BJP groups are busted immediately. This is because everyone in the group has the right to reply to the messages. But in the case of AAP WhatsApp groups the fake news is never battled against.</p>
