<p style="text-align:justify">Believing firmly in a bottoms-up approach when it comes to tribal welfare and development, it is with a passion and drive that Shri Krishna and the entire team at TRIFED has been working the past year towards the implementation and success of the Van Dhan Yojana, especially more so during this unprecedented Covid-19 crisis. The mission is to create an Atmanirbhar Tribal India. Keeping in line with this vision is TRIFED’s ambitious venture, the e-marketplace (market.tribesindia.com) launched on October 2, 2020, that showcases the produce and handicrafts of tribal enterprises from across the country and help them market their produce/ products directly. Connecting 5 lakh tribal enterprises to national and international markets, this is a major leap towards the digitisation of tribal commerce.</p>
