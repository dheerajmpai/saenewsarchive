<p style="text-align:justify">The Objective of Ayurveda Day is to focus on strengths of Ayurveda and its unique treatment principles, to work towards reducing the burden of disease and related mortality by utilising the potential of Ayurveda, to tap into the potential of Ayurveda to contribute towards National Health Policy and National Health programmes, and to promote Ayurvedic principles of healing in society. Thus, Ayurveda Day is more an occasion of re-dedication to the profession and the society, than one of festivities or celebrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Ministry of Ayush, has decided to organise various activities marking the 5th &#8216;Ayurveda Day&#8217;, with a special focus on concerns related to the present pandemic and how Ayurveda can help in immunity building in this context.</p>

About 1.5 lakh participants from all over the world are expected to attend the webinar. The Ministry of Ayush has also requested embassies/missions abroad to observe the &#8216;Áyurveda Day&#8217; with appropriate activities that would engage the public.</p>
