<p style="text-align:justify">The Ministry of Tourism under the leadership of Tourism Minister along with the stakeholders is working tirelessly to support the tourism sector. The Ministry has been in a continuous dialogue with the representatives of Tourism &#038; Hospitality industry stakeholders to discuss solutions and way forward to revive the tourism economy by reviving demand, especially through promotion of Domestic Tourism.

<p style="text-align:justify"> Initiatives of the Tourism Ministry during COVID-19 pandemic &#8211; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">SAATHI : </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">To assist the hospitality industry in their preparedness to continue operations safely and mitigate risks arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Tourism has partnered with the Quality Council of India (QCI), to assist the Hospitality industry through an initiative called SAATHI (System for Assessment, Awareness and Training for Hospitality Industry). This initiative is aligned with the Honble Prime Ministers clarion call for Atmanirbhar Bharat. The idea is not only to sensitize the industry on the COVID regulations by the Government but also to instill confidence amongst the staff and guests that the hospitality unit has exhibited intent towards ensuring safety and hygiene at the workplace.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">SAATHI Standard has been developed based on the COVID-19 guidelines, as issued by the Ministry of Tourism and Ministry of Health &#038; Family Welfare, Government of India. The Standard re-imposes the fact that a Hospitality Unit needs to incorporate a holistic approach in their fight against this pandemic and hence has 10 key elements integrated in its ecosystem that include the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">6.   Transport Management</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">7.    Vendor Management</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">8.    Ventilation</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">9.    Waste Management</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">10.  Control of Discriminatory Practices</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This initiative is in 3 phases:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">SAATHI aims to reach out to maximum hospitality units. Adoption of SAATHI in a hospitality unit not only instills confidence amongst all stakeholders (including staff &#038; Guests) but also enhances its image as that of a responsible Organization that has exhibited intent and commitment towards safety and hygiene of guests, staff and other stakeholders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">National Integrated Database of Hospitality Industry (NIDHI) Scheme : </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The global COVID 19 pandemic highlighted the urgent need for creation of a comprehensive national database of accommodation units in the country, since availability of data is crucial in framing of policies and strategies such as promotion and development of tourism, assisting tourists to find information on places for accommodation, assessing the carrying capacity of various destinations, assessing requirements for skilled human resources and formulating disaster management plans.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Ministry of Tourism with the help of State Governments and Union Territory Administrations is making efforts to register accommodation units in the country in the Ministrys portal National Integrated Database of Hospitality Industry (NIDHI). As on 13.10.2020, 25786 accommodation units have been registered on the portal which was activated on 08.06.2020.</p>
