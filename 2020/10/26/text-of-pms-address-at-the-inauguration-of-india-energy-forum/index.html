<p style="text-align:justify">His Royal Highness Prince Adbul-aziz, Minister of Energy of Saudi Arabia, </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dr. Daniel Yergin,Vice Chairman,IHS Markit, </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">My ColleagueShri Dharmendra Pradhan,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Captains of Global Oil and Gas Industry</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Namaste!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Wonderful to see you allat the Fourth edition ofIndia Energy Forum CERA Week.I would like to congratulateDr. Daniel Yergin, for his contributionto the energy sector.I also congratulate himon his recent book &#8220;The New Map&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Friends,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The theme this yearis relevant.It is- &#8220;India&#8217;s Energy Future in a world of Change&#8221;.I can assure you:India is full of energy! India&#8217;s energy futureis bright and secure.Let me explain why I feel so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Friends,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This year has been challengingfor the energy sector.Energy demandfell by almost one third.There has been price instability.Investment decisionshave been impacted.Leading global bodiesproject thatthere will be a contraction in globalenergy demandover the next few years also.But, these agencies project India to emerge as a leading energy consumer.India is set to nearly doubleits energy consumption over the long term.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Friends,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">There are many areasin whichwe see this vibrancy.For example &#8211; take aviation.India is the third largestand the fastest growing aviation marketin terms of domestic aviation .  Indian carriers are projectedto increase their fleet sizefrom 600 to 1200by 2024.This is a big jump!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Friends,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India believes that access to energy must beaffordable and reliable.That is whensocio-economic transformationscan take place.We view the energy sectoras one that empowers peopleand furthers&#8221;Ease of Living&#8221;.India achievedhundred percent electrification.LPG coverage increased.These changes particularly helped our rural areas,our middle classand the women of India.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Friends,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India&#8217;s Energy Planaims to ensure energy justice.That toowhile fully followingour global commitments for sustainable growth.This means more energyto improve thelives of Indians.But, with a smaller carbon foot-print.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Friends,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Our energy sectorwill be growth centric,industry friendlyand environment conscious.That is why,India is among the most active nations in furthering renewable sources of energy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Friends,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In the last 6 years,more than 36 crore or 360 millionLED bulbs were distributed.The cost of LED bulbshas also reduced 10 fold.In the last 6 years,Over 1.1 crore or 11 million smart LED street-lightswere installed.These have enabledan estimated energy savingsof 60 billion units per year.The estimated green-house gas emission  reductionwith this programme is over 4.5 crore or 45 million tonnes Carbon dioxide annually.Along with all this,we also savedaround Rupees 24,000 crore  or Rupees 240 billion annually.It is due to such interventions that reports have saidthat India is the most attractive emerging market for clean energy investment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Friends,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As I said,India will always work keeping in mind global good.We are well on track to meet the commitment  we made to the global community.We had aimed to increasethe renewable energy installed capacity by 175 GW by 2022.We have further extended this goal to450 GW by 2030.India has one of thelowest carbon emissionsthan the rest of the industrialized world.Yet, we will continue to make effortsto fight climate change.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Friends,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India’s reform journey has been on high speedfor the last six years.The energy sector has seenmany path-breaking reforms.Reforms in Exploration and Licensing Policywere put in place in February 2019.The focus has shifted from &#8216;revenue&#8217; to &#8216;production&#8217; maximisation.There is also focus ongreater transparency andstream-lined procedures We plan to growour refining capacities from about250 to 400 Million Metric tonnesPer Annum by 2025.Increasing domestic gas productionhas been a key government priority.We plan to achieve &#8216;One Nation One Gas Grid&#8217;and shift towards gas-based economy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Friends,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">For too long,the world has seen crude prices on a roller-coaster. We need to move towards responsible pricing.We have to work towardstransparent and flexible marketsfor both oil and gas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Friends,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">To increasedomestic production of natural gas.And, to bring uniformity in the market price discovery of gas, we have announcedNatural Gas Marketing Reforms earlier this month.They will give greater marketing freedomin the sale ofnatural gasthrough e-bidding.India&#8217;s first automated national-level gas trading platform was launched in June this year.This prescribes standard procedures  to discover the market price of gas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Friends,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">We are moving forward with the vision of &#8216;आत्मनिर्भरभारत.&#8217;  A Self-reliant Indiawill also be a Force Multiplier for the global economy.Energy security is at the core of our efforts.You would be happy to know that our work is givingpositive results.During these challenging times, we have witnessed investment through the oil and gas value chain.We are seeing similar signs in others sectors too.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Friends,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">We are driving strategic and comprehensive energy engagements with the key global energy players.As part of India&#8217;s Neighbourhood First Policy, we are developing energy corridors with our neighbouring countries for mutual benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Friends,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Rays of Sun brighten the journey of human progress.Like the seven horses driving the  chariot  of Sun god, India&#8217;s energy map will have seven key drivers.These drivers of change are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">1.  Accelerating our efforts to move towards a gas-based economy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">2.  Cleaner use of fossil fuels particularly petroleum and coal</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">3.  Greater reliance on domestic sources to drive bio-fuels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">4.  Achieving the renewables target of 450 GW by 2030.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">5. Increasing the contribution of electricity to de-carbonize mobility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">6. Moving into the emerging fuels including hydrogen </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">7.  Digital innovation across all the energy systems.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">There will be continuity of these robust energy policies that have been in place over the last six years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Friends,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India Energy Forum- CERA  Week is serving as an important platform between industry, government and society.I am confident that this conference will have fruitful deliberations for a better energy future.I state again- India&#8217;s energy will energise the world! Thank you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Thank you again.</p>
