With effective containment strategy, aggressive testing and standardized clinical management protocols based on holistic Standard of Care protocol across government and private hospitals, the number of new deaths has significantly dipped. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Less than 500 deaths (480) have been reported in last 24 hours in the country. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India has one of the lowest fatality rates in the world. The Case Fatality rate is lowest since 22nd March and is continuously declining. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As part of the COVID management and response policy, there has been a sharp focus of the Central Government on not only containing the COVID, but to reduce deaths and to save lives by providing quality clinical care to the critical and severe patients of COVID. Collaborative efforts of the Union and State/UT governments have resulted in strengthening of the health facilities across the country. 2218 Dedicated COVID Hospitals are providing quality medical care. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">A unique initiative to build the capacities of the ICU doctors in clinical management of critical patients towards reducing the fatality, e-ICU has been started by AIIMS, New Delhi. Twice a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays, tele/video -consultation sessions are held by knowledge and domain experts for the doctors manning ICUs in the State hospitals. These sessions started from 8th July 2020.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Till date, 25 tele-sessions have been held, and 393 institutions across 34 States/UTs have participated in them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">To further build the ICU/clinical management capacities of doctors for treatment of critical patients, AIIMS New Delhi in collaboration with the Health Ministry has developed FAQs. These have been posted on the MoHFW website and can be accessed at:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Also, many States have conducted the population surveys to map and identify the vulnerable population like the elderly, pregnant women and those with co-morbidities. This, with the help of technological solutions like Mobile Apps, has ensured keeping the high-risk population under continuous observation, thus aiding early identification, timely clinical treatment and reducing fatalities. At the ground level, frontline health workers like ASHAs and ANMs have done a commendable job of managing the migrant population and to enhance awareness at the community level. </p>
