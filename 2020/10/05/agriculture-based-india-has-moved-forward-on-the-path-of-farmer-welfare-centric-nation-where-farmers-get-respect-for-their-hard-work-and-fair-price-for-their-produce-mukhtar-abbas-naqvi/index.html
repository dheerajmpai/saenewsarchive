He was addressing farmers during “KisanChaupal” at Village Lodhipur in Moradabad (U.P.).  Shri Naqvi said that the Government’s commitment to double the income of the farmers has “quadrupled the worries of brokers and middlemen”. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Naqvi said that the agriculture reform Acts of the Government are the guarantee of “happiness in eyes and prosperity in life” of crores of the farmers of the country. These Acts will ensure economic empowerment of the farmers by providing them freedom from the clutches of middlemen. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Naqvi said that the Government is committed to prosperity of the farmers. Agriculture reform Acts are a historic step towards prosperity and empowerment of the farmers. As Farmers&#8217; Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act have been passed, now the   farmers will get new opportunities to sell their produce, which will increase their profits. This will give the agriculture sector the benefit of modern technology and the farmers will be empowered. The minimum support price and government procurement will remain in place. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">These Acts will give freedom to farmers for storage and sale of their crops and free them from the clutches of middlemen. Farmers will be liberated from legal restrictions. Farmers will not be compelled to sell their produce to the licensed traders in mandis anymore. Farmers will also get freedom from the tax of government  mandis. The farmers will get their payments within 3 days. The dream of “One Nation, One Market” will be fulfilled. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Naqvi said that Prime Minister is committed to welfare of villages and farmers of the country. Farmers’ rights will be protected by the Government at any cost. Under the “Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi” in the government, more than Rs 92,000 crore has been given to the farmers so far. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Naqvi said that the Shri Narendra Modi has repeatedly said that the system of MSP will continue as before, across the country, and no change will be made. Not only this, the MSP of many crops has been increased. MSP of Wheat has been increased to Rs 1975 per quintal; Barley Rs 1600; Gram Rs 5100; MasurRs 5100, Rapeseed &#038; Mustard Rs 4650 and Safflower Rs 5327 per quintal. </p>
