<p style="text-align:justify">It had come to the notice of the Ministry that the ownership details are not properly reflected under the ownership under the various forms under CMVR required for registration of the Motor Vehicels. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In view of this, it has amended the FORM 20 of the CMVR 1989 to capture detailed ownership type as :-     “4A. Ownership type AUTONOMOUS BODY  CENTRAL GOVERNMENT  CHARITABLE TRUST  DRIVING TRAINING SCHOOL   DIVYANJAN  (a) AVAILING GST CONCESSION    (b) WITHOUT AVAILING GST CONCESSION    EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTE   FIRM   GOVTUNDERTAKING   INDIVIDUAL  LOCAL AUTHORITY  MULTIPLE OWNER  OTHERS  POLICE DEPARTMENT  STATE GOVERNMENT  STATE TRANSPORT CORP/DEPT”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Further, the benefits of GST and other concessions being provided to the Divyangjan (Physically challenged Persons) under various schemes of the Government for the purchase / ownership  / operation of the Motor Vehicles.   As per the current  details under CMVR 1989, the ownership captured does not reflect the details of the Divyangjan citizens.  It becomes difficult for such citizens to properly avail various benefits available under Government Schemes like the benefits to the Divyangjan as per  scheme for financial incentives of the Department of Heavy Industries.  With the proposed amendments, such ownership details would be properly reflected and divyangjan would be able to avail the benefits under various schemes. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The suggestions and comments in this respect were sought from public on 19th August, 2020.</p>
