<p style="text-align:justify">India is an important player in the global Oil and gas sector being the 3rd largest consumer of crude oil and the 4th largest LNG importer. Realizing the need for India to graduate from a passive consumer to an active and vocal stake-holder in the global Oil &#038; Gas value chain, NITI Aayog initiated the first roundtable of global Oil &#038; Gas CEOs with the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India in 2016. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The growth of the event was apparent as around 45-50 global CEOs and key stakeholders who shape the global Oil &#038; Gas sector assembled every subsequent year to interact and discuss the issues and opportunities with the Hon’ble Prime Minister. The impact of the annual global CEO’s interaction can be seen in the gravity of discussion, quality of suggestions and the seriousness with which they are acted upon. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This the 5th such event organized by NITI Aayog and Ministry of Petroleum &#038; Natural Gas. Around 45 CEOs of major Oil and Gas companies will attend the event this year.  </p>

The annual interaction has gradually become one of the most important gatherings of not only intellectual debate but also of executive action.
