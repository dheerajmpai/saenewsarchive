<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Rajnath Singh also laid the Foundation Stone of the strategically important Nechiphu Tunnel on the road to Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh.

<p style="text-align:justify">Briefing the dignitaries, Lt Gen Harpal Singh, DG BRO, said the 44 bridges of various spans ranging from 30 mtrs to 484 mtrs are located in J&#038;K (10), Ladakh (08), Himachal Pradesh (02), Punjab (04), Uttarakhand (08), Arunachal Pradesh (08) and Sikkim (04). They are of strategic importance and have been designed to facilitate movement of heavy civil &#038; military traffic in border areas.

<p style="text-align:justify">He said that in addition to expediting road construction, the BRO has laid special emphasis on construction of bridges by completing 28 major bridges last year while 102 major bridges are being completed this year. 54 of these bridges have already been completed. Over 60 Bailey Bridges have also been constructed by BRO to meet immediate requirements of armed forces and people living in remote areas. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">BRO has worked relentlessly even during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic restrictions continuing with works of strategic importance like Construction of Major Bridges &#038; Roads, Atal Tunnel Rohtang, Sela Tunnel etc, and Snow Clearance for opening of Strategic Mountain Passes. </p>

This brought relief to people of border areas and ensured rapid &#038; early movement of troops &#038; logistics.</p>
