<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Part of the Sustainable Growth pillar of the US–India Strategic Energy Partnership (SEP), IEMF aims to engage Indian researchers, knowledge partners, think tanks and national and international government agencies and departments for modelling and long-term energy planning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The governing structure of IEMFwill consist of an inter-ministerial and a steering committee.The inter-ministerial committee will be convened by NITI Aayog and headed by its CEO,and comprise senior officials from the ministries of petroleum and natural gas; power; new and renewable energy; coal; environment, forest and climate change; and department of science and technology.

<p style="text-align:justify">India and the US have a long-standing collaboration on energy. The Sustainable Growth pillar, one of the four of the US–India SEP, is being chaired by NITI Aayog and USAID. This pillar brings together Indian and USresearchers and decision-makers to collaborate in three focal areas: energy data management;energy modelling, andpromotion of low carbon technologies. IEMF was launched under the area of energy modelling. Through collaborations with global energy modelling forums, such as Stanford Energy Modelling Forum and Energy Modelling Platform for Europe,IEMFhopes to share and learn from best practices.</p>
