SAI will be paying a total of Rs. 1.46 Lakhs for their hotel stay and food expenses and will release 90 percent of the amount immediately.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The two players were scheduled to play the SaarLorLux Open in Saarbrucken this week but pulled out as they had been training with Lakshya Sen who had pulled out of the tournament earlier. While both players had tested COVID negative on arrival in Germany, they had trained with Lakshya whose coach DK Senâ€™s covid report had come positive on October 27. As a close contact, they withdrew from the tournament so as to not jeopardise the safety of the other players and hamper the functioning of the tournament.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">SAI is in constant touch with the Indian Consulate in Frankfurt to facilitate the situation involving the two players.</p>
