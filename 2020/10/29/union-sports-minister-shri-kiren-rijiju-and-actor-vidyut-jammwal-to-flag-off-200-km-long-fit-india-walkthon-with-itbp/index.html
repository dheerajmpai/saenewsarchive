<p style="text-align:justify">Speaking about the upcoming event, Shri Kiren Rijiju said, &#8220;It was the clarion call of our PM to make the Fit India Movement a People&#8217;s Movement. I am extremely happy that the brave soldiers of our armed forces have come together to promote the importance of fitness through this unique walkathon. I will be joining them in Jaisalmer and participating in the walk along with them. To take the Fit India Movement to every corner of the country is a key initiative of the Sports Ministry.&#8221; </p>
