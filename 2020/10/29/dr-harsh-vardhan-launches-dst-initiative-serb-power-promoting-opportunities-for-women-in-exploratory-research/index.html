<p style="text-align:justify">The launch which was attended byProfessor Ashutosh Sharma, Chairman, SERB &#038; Secretary, DST, Professor Sandeep Verma, Secretary, SERB and Scientists from Ministry of Science and Technologyechoed the intent of the government to bring more numbers of women scientists in the R&#038;D ecosystem. Thus, SERB-POWER Fellowship and Grants will also serve as a benchmark of recognition in the national scenario.These Schemes of the Government will definitely empower women scientists and cultivate women friendly culture in our academic and research institutions and ensure more women in leadership positions in decision making bodies.</p>
