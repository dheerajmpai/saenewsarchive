The countrywide surveys conducted by impartial agencies have also testified this, he said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The DoNER Minister made these observations when the Health Minister of Meghalaya A L Hek called on him to discuss the various COVID related issues.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Dr Jitendra Singh appreciated the Government of Meghalaya and other State Governments for having taken proactive steps from the beginning of COVID pandemic to break the transmission chain and strengthen the existing health systems to meet any surge in cases. He said, it is not a small achievement that during the lockdown period, almost five out of eight States of North East remained Corona-free and Corona positive cases began to appear only after the movement of people started. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The DoNER Minister noted that just as the North East had emerged as a model of development in the last 6 years, it has emerged as a model for effective Corona management in the last six months.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">While the Ministry of North East (DoNER), Dr Jitendra Singh said, provided in the beginning itself an initial support of Rs. 25 crores to the North Eastern States as a pre-emptive move even before the lockdown, the State governments of different North Eastern States were also prompt in initiating early effective measures. In this regard, he referred to the proposals from at least three North Eastern States to set up Infectious Disease Hospitals as a futuristic step to meet any such infection epidemic in future. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">On the directions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Dr Jitendra Singh disclosed that sufficient supply of oxygen had been made available well in advance to all the peripheral territories including North Eastern States as well as Union Territories of Jammu &#038; Kashmir and Ladakh. However, the effective arrangement and operation of ventilators ensured that there was not a single complaint from the North East of any patient having suffered on account of lack of non &#8211; availability of oxygen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dr Jitendra Singh also lauded the role of civil society, particularly the Women Self Groups, who worked day and night in the early phase of lockdown to ensure that Face Masks were not only available in sufficient numbers but also available in different varieties and designs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
<p style="text-align:justify">While the Health Minister A L Hek placed on record the State governments appreciation of the services rendered by ASHA workers and Anganwadi workers, the DoNER Minister noted that just as North East has emerged as model of development in last 6 years, it has emerged as model for effective management of Corona pandemic in last six months as well. </p>
