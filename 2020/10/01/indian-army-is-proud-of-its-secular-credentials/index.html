Having failed consistently to incite religion-based disaffection within the country, Pakistan, in a desperate attempt, is now trying to create a divide within the Indian Army.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Â The Indian Army categorically rejects such malicious attempts to defame the institution. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Indian Army is a secular organisation and all officers and soldiers serve the Nation with pride irrespective of their religion, caste, creed or gender.</p>
