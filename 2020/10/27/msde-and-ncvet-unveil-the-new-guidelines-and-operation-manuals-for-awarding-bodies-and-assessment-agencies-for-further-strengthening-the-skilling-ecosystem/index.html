The guidelines aim at establishing quality, improved outcomes and standardizing the processes under Skill India Mission. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Stressing upon the need for these dynamic guidelines under the vision of skilled India,  Dr. Mahendra Nath Pandey said, “Our country caters to a diverse skilling ecosystem which is supported by key stakeholders, and organizations. Therefore, it is imperative to have a vibrant policy framework that encourages improvements and key transformations in the skilling network. I am pleased with the addition of the regulator — NCVET responsible for quality assurance and formalizing the qualifications. The innovative methods and constructive tools underlined in the guidelines in the management of the skilling institutions will create a regulated regime. I congratulate NCVET for their concerted efforts and for carrying detailed round of consultations for designing these guidelines.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dr. Pandey added, “Our honorable Prime Minister said that ‘skilling, reskilling and upskilling are key for staying relevant in the current times’. With this dynamic and outcome focused document, we will be able to bring in positive reforms in both short term and long term skilling endeavors and strengthen the regulation of bodies that certify a skilled candidate across sectors. A skilling paradigm has already been put in place, with approximately 5.5 Crore youth having been trained during the last five years. These reforms will further prove to be a game changer in the skilling domain.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India’s diverse skilling ecosystem caters to multiple levels of skilling in various sectors. Therefore the need of the hour is to have a dynamic robust strategy framework that encourages improvements at a vast level. The guidelines released today address the needs of many key stakeholders and takes an approach of good governance. The prepared guidelines take into account the existing systems while incorporating the progressive changes required to empower every candidate who desires to be skilled. </p>
