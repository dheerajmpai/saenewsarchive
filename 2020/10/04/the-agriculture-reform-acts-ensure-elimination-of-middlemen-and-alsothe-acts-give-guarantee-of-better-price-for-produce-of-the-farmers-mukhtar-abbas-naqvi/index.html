<p style="text-align:justify">Union Minister Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi today held “KisanChaupal” with farmers at Village Hurhuri at Mirganj in Bareilly and Village Dhanaili at Milak in Rampur, in Uttar Pradesh. Addressing them, Shri Naqvi said that there are attempts to create fear and confusion over agriculture reform Acts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Naqvi said that while on one hand the agriculture reform Acts ensure elimination of middlemen on the other hand the Acts give guarantee of better price for produce of the farmers.  The Modi government is taking steps to empower the farmers, he said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Naqvi said that as Farmers&#8217; Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act have been passed, now the   farmers will get new opportunities to sell their produce, which will increase their profits. This will give the agriculture sector the benefit of modern technology and the farmers will be empowered. The minimum support price and government procurement will remain in place. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">These Acts will give freedom to farmers for storage and sale of their crops and free them from the clutches of middlemen. Farmers will be liberated from legal restrictions. Farmers will not be compelled to sell their produce to the licensed traders in mandis anymore. Farmers will also get freedom from the tax of government mandis. The farmers will get their payments within 3 days. The dream of “One Nation, One Market” will be fulfilled. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Naqvi said that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is committed to welfare of villages and farmers of the country. Farmers’ rights will be protected by the Government at any cost. Under the “Prime Minister KisanSamman Nidhi”, more than Rs 92,000 crore has been given to the farmers so far. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Naqvi said also pointed out that the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has repeatedly said that the system of MSP will continue as before, across the country, and no change will be made. Not only this, the MSP of many crops has been increased. MSP of Wheat has been increased to Rs 1975 per quintal; Barley Rs 1600; Gram Rs 5100; Masur Rs 5100, Rapeseed &#038; Mustard Rs 4650 and Safflower Rs 5327 per quintal. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Naqvi said that during the UPA in 2009-10, the agriculture budget was Rs 12,000 crore, which has been raised to Rs 1.34 lakh crore by Modi Government; Soil Health Cards have been given to more than 22 crore farmers; FasalBimaYojna has benefitted about 8 crore farmers; Rs. 6,850 crore are being spent on 10,000 new Farmers Production Organisations by Modi government; Rs. 1 Lakh Crore announced for Agriculture Sector under AatmNirbhar Package; provision of Rs 15 lakh crore for farmer’s loan against earlier Rs 8 lakh crore; under the “Prime Minister KisanMaan-Dhan”, there is provision of minimum Rs 3,000 / month pension to farmers after attaining the age of 60 years; talking about the payment of MSP, the Modi government has paid Rs 7 lakh crore to the farmers in 6 years, which is double that of the UPA government. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">On contract farming, Shri Naqvi said that the fact is that the farmers will have all the freedom to decide price of their produce and if a farmer is not satisfied by the contract, he can cancel the contract. The agriculture reform bills give 100 per cent guarantee for protection of the farmers’ interests. </p>
