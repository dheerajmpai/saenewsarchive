Khadi has become a household name and the number of Khadi lovers is constantly growing. And despite a manifold increase in production, KVIC has ensured highest quality of its product range that has kept our consumer base intact,” Saxena said. He added although the sale figure this year fell just short of the last year’s mark because of the pandemic, the over Rs 1 crore single-day sale figure was still quite satisfactory.</p>
