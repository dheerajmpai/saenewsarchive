<p style="text-align:justify">From merely one in Janauary 2020, India’s total tests have crossed 7.89 crore so far. There has been a commensurate dip in the Positivity Rate. With progressively falling Positivity Rate, testing has worked as a highly effective tool to limit the spread of COVID-19 infection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Very high levels of testing lead to early identification, prompt isolation &#038; effective treatment of COVID-19 cases. These have eventually resulted in a sustained low Fatality Rate.</p>
