Under Jal Jeevan Mission, priority is being given on water quality surveillance through active participation of frontline functionaries as well as involving the local community. 5 persons especially women are being trained in every village to use the Field Test Kits to test the quality of water. Every source needs to be tested once every year for physical and chemical parameters and twice for bacteriological contamination. </p>

The State reported that out of 50,518 Anganwadi centres, 31,031 have drinking water facility. However, a detailed analysis needs to be carried on the type of facility, quantity, quality, etc. and plan for coverage. The State was advised to actively work on the 100-day campaign launched by Ministry of Jal Shakti on 2nd October, 2020 to ensure potable water supply in all schools and Anganwadi centres across the country. </p>
