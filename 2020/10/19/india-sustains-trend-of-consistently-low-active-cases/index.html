The national cumulative Positivity Rate has fallen under 8%. This trend has been sustained without a break for four days. The cumulative Positivity Rate is 7.94% now and is on a continuous decline.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This has been brought about by high level of comprehensive country-wide testing. The total tests have crossed 9.5 crores today. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As evidence has revealed, higher numbers of testing on a sustained basis have aided in bringing down the positivity rate. The decline in the cumulative positivity rate has demonstrated that the rate of spread of infection is being effectively contained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Higher testing across wide regions leads to early identification of positive cases, prompt tracking through efficient surveillance and tracing, and timely &#038; effective treatment in homes/facilities and in hospitals for the severe cases. These measures in tandem eventually lead to lower mortality rate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The average Daily Positivity Rate is 6.13% for the third week of October. This is a result of successful TEST, TRACK, TRACE, TREAT and TECHNOLOGY strategy of the Central government effectively followed by States/UTs.</p>
