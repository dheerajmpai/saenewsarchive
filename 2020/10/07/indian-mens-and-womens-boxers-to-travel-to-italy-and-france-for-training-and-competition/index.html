<p style="text-align:justify">Ashish Kumar, Men’s 75 kg boxer said that this is good preparation as they would be coming up against opponents who they might face at the Olympics, “It will be very helpful for us to play against competitors from abroad.

It will help us get a better idea of where we stand and what aspects we need to improve on.”</p>

Thank the government for sanctioning this. The boxers are very happy, they wanted to do something different, they need competition and training. They want to see where they stand compared to the European boxers. This overseas exposure will give a better idea of competition from Europe.”</p>
