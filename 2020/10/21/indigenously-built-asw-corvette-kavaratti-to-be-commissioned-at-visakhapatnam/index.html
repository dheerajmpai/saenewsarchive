<p style="text-align:justify">            Touted as a potent Stealth ASW Corvette, Kavaratti is indigenously designed by the Indian Navy&#8217;s in-house organisation, Directorate of Naval Design(DND), and built by Garden Reach Shipbuilders &#038; Engineers (GRSE), Kolkata, and portrays the growing capability of the Indian Navy, GRSE and the nation in becoming self-reliant through indigenization, thus, accentuating our national objective of “Atmanirbhar Bharat”. The ship has up to 90% indigenous content and the use of carbon composites for the superstructure is a commendable feat achieved in Indian shipbuilding. The ship’s weapons and sensors suite is predominantly indigenous and showcases the nation’s growing capability in this niche area.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">            Kavaratti has a state-of-the-art weapons and sensor suite capable of detecting and prosecuting submarines. In addition to its anti-submarine warfare capability, the ship also has a credible self defence capability and good endurance for long-range deployments. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">            It is noteworthy that the ship will be commissioned into the Navy as a combat-ready platform as the ship has completed sea trials of all the systems fitted onboard. It is a praiseworthy achievement in itself, taking into consideration the restrictions imposed due to ongoing COVID-19 pandemic during which she was delivered to the Navy. With the induction of Kavaratti into its fold, the Indian Navy’s preparedness will be enhanced. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">            Kavaratti takes her name from erstwhile INS Kavaratti which was an Arnala class missile corvette. The older Kavaratti distinguished herself by operating in support of was Bangladesh&#8217;s liberation in 1971. </p>
