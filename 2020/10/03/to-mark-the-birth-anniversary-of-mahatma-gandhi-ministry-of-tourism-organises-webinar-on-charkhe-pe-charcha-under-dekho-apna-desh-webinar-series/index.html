The Webinar titled “Charkhe pe Charcha” focused on spinning wheel and Khadi.  Khadi, the moral fabric of the nation is a metaphor for swarajya and swavalamban. Nowhere in world history would you find the anti-colonial narrative spun around a fabric like in the case of India. From the boycott of foreign cloth to the promotion of handspun, handwoven khaddar, the spinning wheel or the charkha is a political and emotional symbol for India and this narrative is the gift of one man, Mahatma Gandhi, whose vision for a self-reliant village and spiritual cleansing were all tied to the yarn on the wheel. The webinar seeks to explore the dimensions of khadi in the freedom struggle of India and explores the journey of NIFT, Bengaluru in contemporising khadi and spreading the message of Bapu.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">In 1918, Mahatma Gandhi started his movement for Khadi as relief programme for the poor masses living in India&#8217;s villages. Spinning and weaving was elevated to an ideology for self-reliance and self government. Every village shall plant and harvest its own raw-materials for yarn, every woman and man shall engage in spinning and every village shall weave whatever is needed for its own use.  Gandhi saw it as the end of dependency on foreign materials and thus giving a first lesson or real independence. Raw materials at that time were entirely exported to England and then re-imported as costly finished cloth, depriving the local population of work and profits on it.  It was for economic, cultural and social reasons and not merely political that Gandhi established the Khadi Movement. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">On his second visit to Madurai on September 20, 1921, Gandhi stayed in the West Masi Street and when he saw the daily wage labourers going to work without a shirt he was deeply moved by their plight, he removed his attire and adorned the four metre Khadi dhoti on the night of September 21. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The next day, on, September 22, 1922, when he went to address the people at a place in Kamaraj Street, now called as Gandhi Pottal dressed only in his khadi veshti, people asked him the reason.The place where he stayed in 1921 is now a Khadi Kraft store, but a stone tablet in the building records the historic change of attire. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In 1934-35 he expanded the idea from helping the poor individual to self-reliance of whole villages. In 1942-43 he had sessions with workers groups and village organizers to re-organize the whole programme on a bigger country-wide scale. Thus Khadi became not mere a piece of cloth but a way of life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Mr. Prashanth highlighted the role played by NIFT in contemporizing Khadi and Strengthening the Karnataka State Khadi and Village Industries Board Brand through Integrated Product Mapping, Design Intervention, Product Diversification and Development, Training and Marketing Activities.  The journey of Namma Khadi was an initiative to restore the pride and position of Brand Karnataka Khadi.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dharwad is the only place in Karnataka where coloured cotton is grown.  A panel of experts from NIFT Bengaluru have designed more than 400 products for the review and these were reviewed in the presence of Chairman, KSK&#038;VIB and many artisans and the most viable products were selected for imparting training to the artisans.The feedback from the stakeholders of this business has been very encouraging. He further stated that with the co-operation and the partnership of KSK&#038;VIB, NIFT would be able to position Brand Khadi effectively for the contemporary market not only in India but also at global level. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Summing up the webinar Rupinder Brar , Additional Director General said that we should not  only be proud  of  our heritage and culture but also do our bit towards upliftment and encouragement of  artisans by buying and wearing Khadi.  It is important for us to live up to the value systems shown to us by Gandhiji and spread them far and wide.
