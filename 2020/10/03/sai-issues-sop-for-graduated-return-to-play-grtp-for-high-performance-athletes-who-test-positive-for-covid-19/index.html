<p style="text-align:justify">Under the new guidelines, termed &#8220;Graduated Return to Play&#8221; (GRTP), all SAI officials and centres have been asked to monitor the progression ofathletes who have tested positive for COVID-19 virus and are undergoing training in SAI facilities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The SOP has been divided into three categories, based on COVID -19 cases.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">*Category One: COVID-19 Positive &#038; Asymptomatic (mild localized symptoms that resolve within 10 days*</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">*Category Two: COVID-19 Positive &#038; Prolonged Course (Regional / systemic symptoms for more than 10 days) or severe symptoms that required hospitalisation*</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">*Category Three: COVID-19 Positive &#038; Symptoms during GRTP progression* (Post recovery complications)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Under the new guidelines, all SAI officials have been given strict instructions and added responsibilities with regards to training athletes who test positive for COVID 19 virus.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">SAI is also identifying medical and paramedical experts to designate at each Centre to ensure clinical assessment of COVID-19 infection on the athletes and implementation of the guidelines stated within the SOP.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">These designated medical and paramedical experts are being instructed to ensure clarity with regards to the GRTP progression in the result of the Post COVID-19 Infection Clinical Assessment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Further, coaches have been instructed to plan a physical activity at 50% of normal intensity and volume for an otherwise healthy patient with a self-limiting course of COVID-19 who has been asymptomatic for 7 days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Medical and Paramedical Staff have been asked to monitor the progress of the athletes regularly and give advice to athletes and coaches for gradual resumption to training.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Athletes would be monitored before, during and after the exercise sessions and if any unwarranted symptoms are there it would be reported to the medical team for further assessment.</p>
