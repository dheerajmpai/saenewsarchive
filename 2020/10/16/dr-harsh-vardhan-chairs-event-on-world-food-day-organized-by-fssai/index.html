The event was organized by FSSAI. This year’s theme is Grow, Nourish, Sustain. Together. Sh. Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare joined the programme through video conference.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
<p style="text-align:justify">Dr Harsh Vardhan stated that due to the unprecedented challenges faced by the world on account of the pandemic, there has been a renewed focus on food, nutrition, health, immunity and sustainability. He added “FSSAI’s Eat Right India movement targets to promote safe and healthy food for everyone in an environmentally sustainable way.  It is a part of its mandate to provide safe and wholesome food for all citizens. This will improve the food safety ecosystems and lift the hygiene and health of our citizens.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">A key focus this year is elimination of Trans Fats from the food supply chain. A food toxin present in Partially Hydrogenated Vegetable Oils (PHVOs) (e.g. vanaspati, shortening, margarine, etc.), baked and fried foods, Trans Fat is a major contributor to the rise in non-communicable diseases in India. Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated, “Trans fat is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Eliminating CVD risk factor is especially relevant during COVID-19 as people with CVD are predisposed to have serious conditions having an impact on mortality.” He reminded everyone of the government’s effort to make India Trans Fat free by 2022, a year ahead of WHO’s target, in synergy with the Prime Minister Sh. Narendra Modi ji’s vision of a New India on 75 years of the country’s independence. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Reiterating the game changing potential of ‘Eat Right India’ and ‘Fit India Movement’, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said, “These two movements along with Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Jal Jeevan Mission and other efforts of the Environment Ministry will improve the health of Indians and heal the environment.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Expressing his amazement at the marvels of the internet where curious citizens can look up things on the whole gamut of information available, he asked officials of FSSAI to promote awareness and consumer education leveraging technology so that informed citizens can make responsible choices. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He launched the Eat Right Creativity Challenge for schools which is a poster and photography competition and aims to promote healthy dietary habits.
