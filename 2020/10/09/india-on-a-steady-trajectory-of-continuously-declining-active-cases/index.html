After a month, for the first time, active cases fall below the 9 lakh mark. India registered 8.93 lakh active cases today after registering 8.97 lakh on 9th September. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Presently the active cases stand at 8,93,592 and comprise merely 12.94% of the total positive cases of the country demonstrating a steady falling percentage of the total cases. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">With increasing number of recoveries, this gap is continuously widening.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">New Recoveries in India have exceeded the New Cases for three continuous weeks, unabated. The new cases during these three weeks have displayed a steady trend of decline.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This is the result of collaborative action by States/UTs under the Centre&#8217;s strategy of comprehensive testing, tracking, quick hospitalization and adherence to the Standard Treatment Protocol which has ensured a standardised quality of medical care across the public and private hospitals and for the home isolation cases.</p>
