<p style="text-align:justify">It may be noted that though this payment is being made for last year’s performance i.e. 2019-20 , even this year during COVID period,  a lot of hard work has been put in by Railways employees in movement of shramik specials , for movement of essential commodities including Foodgrains, Fertilizers, Coal etc and completion of more than 200 vital maintenance projects  during lock down period  which would boost safety and all round  efficiency in railway operations. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Even on the freight side there has been major improvement post COVID lock down period. Freight speeds have almost doubled now as compared to last year. Freight loading has also increased by 14% for period of October 2020 as compared to similar period last year.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The payment of the PLB for 2019-20 is expected to motivate the employees for working towards improving the performance of the Railways further. The acknowledgement of their work will enhance the sense of inclusiveness and belongingness in Railway families. It is expected to enhance the productivity levels further.</p>
