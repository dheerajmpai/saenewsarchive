Tripura has around 8.01 lakh households, out of which 1.16 lakh (14%) households have tap water connections. State has planned to provide 100% tap connections in all households by 2023. The State also has a good drinking water supply infrastructure and has water supply schemes in all 1,178 villages. State&#8217;s target for 2020-21 is to provide 3.20 lakh tap water connections, and 44,000connections have been provided so far. State is all set to provide 50,000 tap connections per month starting November and thus, about 1,500 tap connections per day. State also plans to achieve 277 &#8216;HarGhar Jal&#8217; villages and 12 &#8216;HarGhar Jal&#8217; blocks in 2020-21.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">State has constituted Village Water &#038; Sanitation Committees in all its 1,178 villages. 250 villages have completed their Village Action Plans for implementation of mission works which inter alia includes source strengthening, water supply infrastructure, greay water management and operation &#038; maintenance. Emphasis is given on engaging voluntary organizations, NGOs, women SHGs as implementation support agencies (ISAs) to handhold the local community for planning, implementation and operation &#038; maintenance of water supply systems. State was asked to organize training for capacity building of Gram Panchayat functionaries as well as other stakeholders and also to focus on skill development training in villages to create a pool of trained human resources at village level, which will be very helpful in implementation as well O&#038;M of water supply systems. The State was advised to carry out the mandatory chemical testing and bacteriological testing of drinking water sources.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">State is also sensitizing concerned departments to provide piped water supply to every anganwadicentre, school and ashramshala (tribal residential school) as per the mandate of the 100-day campaign launched on 2nd October, 2020.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In 2020-21, Tripurahad opening balance of ₹ 136.46 Crore and has been allocated ₹ 156.61 Crore for implementation of Jal Jeevan Mission. ₹ 17.74 Crore was released in 2020-21 thus State has total available fund of ₹ 154.20 Crore. To avail the second tranche of first release, the State has to expedite their fund utilization. Tripura has also been allocated ₹ 38 Crore under 15th Finance Commission Grants to rural local bodies and 50% of it is to be used for water supply and sanitation i.e. water supply, grey-water treatment and re-use and most importantly for ensuring long-term operation and maintenance of drinking water supply schemes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Tripurareceives ample rainfall and thus water availability is not an issue. And, by having 100% piped water supply system in all villages, it can capitalize on retrofitting/ augmentation of water supply systems to ensure every rural household has assured potable water supply,thereby improving the lives of people and bringing &#8216;ease of living&#8217;.</p>
