Taxpayers can now view their bill of entries data which is received by the GST System (GSTN) from ICEGATE System (Customs). The present data upload has been done on a trial basis to give a feel of the functionality and to get feedback from the taxpayers on the same. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Currently, the system is displaying data up to 6th August, 2020. Further, taxpayers may note that system is currently does not contain import information for bill of entries filed at non-computerized ports (non-EDI ports) and imports made through courier services/post office. This will be made available shortly. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It may also be noted that amendment information made in the details of bill of entries will also be provided soon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Taxpayers are requested that they share their feedback through raising a ticket on the self-service portal (https://selfservice.gstsystem.in/)</p>
