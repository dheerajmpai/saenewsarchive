Venkaiah Naidu greeted people on the eve of Onam through a message.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The following is the full text of the message:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I extend my warm greetings to people of our country on the auspicious occasion of Onam. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Onam is celebrated to honor the memory of the legendary King Mahabali, the honest, just, fair, kind and compassionate ruler of Kerala. Onam day is marked by traditional games, music and dancing and the delectable ‘onasadya’, the grand feast. Beautiful flower carpets are laid to welcome king Mahabali into homes and hearts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This Onam, while we celebrate material prosperity, let us also remind ourselves of the values of honesty, integrity, kindness, compassion, selflessness and sacrifice which the great king Mahabali espoused. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Onam is an occasion for family and friends to come together and celebrate. But this year, given the unprecedented health emergency we face due to the spread of COVID-19, I urge my fellow citizens to celebrate Onam in a modest way at home, strictly adhering to COVID health and hygiene protocols. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">May this joyous festival usher in a new era of peace, prosperity and happiness in our country.</p>
