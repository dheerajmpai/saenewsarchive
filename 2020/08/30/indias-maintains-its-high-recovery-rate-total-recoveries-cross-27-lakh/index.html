Recovery of 27,13,933 patients has been made possible because of effective implementation of the Centre conceived and led policy of TESTING aggressively, TRACKING comprehensively  through timely surveillance of close contacts,&#038; TREATING effectively through a widening medical care infrastructure across the country.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">With the recovery of 64,935 cases in the last 24 hours, India&#8217;s Recovery Rate amongst the COVID-19 patients has improved to 76.61% and is demonstrating a continuous progress. The number of patients recovering is on a steady rise over the past several months.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The number of recoveries in India today exceeds the active cases by 3.55 times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India has posted nearly 19.5 lakh (19,48,631) recoveries more than the active cases (765302, which are under active medical care). The record high recoveries have ensured that the actual caseload of the country viz. the active cases, continues to decline and currently comprises only 21.60% of the total positive cases. This has aided the fast widening gap between the number of patients recovered and the active cases.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Timely and effective clinical management of the patients in critical care through a slew of holistic measures has been instrumental in keeping the Case Fatality Rate low and on a steady downward trajectory. It has further dipped to 1.79% today.</p>
