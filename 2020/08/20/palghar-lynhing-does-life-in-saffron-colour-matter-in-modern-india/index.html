<p><strong>&#8211; By Sukanya Subhadarshana</strong></p>



<p>“Non-violence is the greatest force at the disposal of mankind. It is mightier than the mightiest weapon of destruction devised by the ingenuity of men”<sup><a href="#post-26011-footnote-0">[1]</a></sup>.</p>



<p>&#8211; Mahatma Gandhi</p>



<p>The world today is striving hard to survive the China borne Corona Virus which has been a catastrophe to mankind and every country is diligently working towards the development of a vaccine which could be a possible solution to its widespread. India has become one of the worst corona virus hit countries and its politicians have come up to discuss about their parties novel agendas to assist people at the times of need by citing selfless examples of how conscientiously they can deal with the situation and how comparatively they are better than the others. Besides the pandemic there are a number of events that have been given attention and one of the foremost is the lynching of two Sadhus in the Palghar district.</p>



<p>Sadhus who are considered as holy man<sup><a href="#post-26011-footnote-1">[2]</a></sup> have been an inseparable part of Hindu culture and were given the position of god in Indian mythology. In ancient India saints were prayed and were regarded to be the only source of communication between god and ordinary men. It is only when in Modern day India, frauds for the sake of extorting money from religious zealots pose to be messengers of divinity. After several revelations of the sages to be swindlers the common people have developed a sense of distrust and disbelieve against the whole community of saints. The colour of saffron is no more believed to be holy, none of the existing ascetics are considered innocent and the Palghar Lynching is a classical example to state so.</p>



<p><strong>The story of the dreadful lynching explained.</strong></p>



<p>On 16<sup>th</sup> of April, 2020<sup><a href="#post-26011-footnote-2">[3]</a></sup>, amid the Corona Virus tensions when the entire country was following the lockdown procedures imposed by the government, Gadchinchale, a village located in Dhanu Taluka of the Palghar district<sup><a href="#post-26011-footnote-3">[4]</a></sup> of Maharashtra is the location where the brutal attack was carried out by a vigilante mob of villagers on two sadhus namely Maharaj Kalpavrikshgiri aged 70 and Sushil Giri Maharaj aged 35 who belonged to the Varanasi-based Juna Akhara<sup><a href="#post-26011-footnote-4">[5]</a></sup> were beaten to death along with their driver. The two sadhus who stayed in Kandivali, Mumbai, in order to attend the funeral of their guru in Silvassa, Gujurat preferred to pass through lanes of villages and not the Mumbai- Gujurat highway<sup><a href="#post-26011-footnote-5">[6]</a></sup> due to the closure of exit points on the main roads. Their car was stopped at a local checkpoint by the forest department sentry and while they were having a word with the sentry members, a murderous group of villagers attacked them with axes sticks and iron rods in the presence of police men just because of some disturbing rumour which the villagers believed to be true. The rumors were circulated over Whatsapp and Facebook that firstly, members of minority who were infected with the corona virus would sneak into Hindu neighbourhood areas in order to spread the virus and would pose as sadhus, policemen or doctors and secondly that there was an active group of child kidnappers who indulged in organ harvesting were in search of remote villages. The villagers thought that the deceased were pseudo sadhus and not real ones and attacked them in order to protect themselves without any discovery of their real life identities. The lynching can be observed through different dimensions and has raised several questions:</p>



<p><strong>Choosing silence over an attack which demanded eloquence?</strong></p>



<p>The Palghar lynchings which gained media hype after some of the state run media houses threw light on the issue initially was in oblivion. The question arises as to why did the liberals, the award wapsi gang who pose themselves as human rights activist<sup><a href="#post-26011-footnote-6">[7]</a></sup>, various media houses, the Lutyens media, the diplomats, the Congress, the BJP and other parties chose to stay silent on the gruesome killing of the two Sanyasis and their driver? Was it because the colour was saffron or because this was not communal or may be because the saints are found to be in minority numbers these days their killing does not concern anybody or was this above all some kind of a conspiracy? Too many questions but so little to answer!</p>



<p><strong>Where does the community of Saints stand in modern India?</strong></p>



<p>Is the entire community of Sadhus, their identities only relatable to that of thieves, organ harvesters and child kidnappers and not with any of the decent professions. Is the only way of providing justice to the minority possible by creation of defending cacophony to regard them as humans and give them some importance for their advancement and quality of life. The death was not even condemned by the so called authorities who are entrusted to ensure law and justice or may be they did not because they failed to provide with any of these. It is yet to be discovered about what really was the rationale behind the murder, if it was some kind of a planned conspiracy or any rumor, which for the fact are called so because they can be fueled into the air by any laymen or was it just the anger of the tribes for normalization of their hate and motive to take lives of innocents.</p>



<p><strong>The Communal shape given to the lynching.</strong></p>



<p>All the burning events that happen in India is not paid any heed unless it takes the shape of a communal riot. There was no coverage of the entire situation by the 24×7 alert media, was the entire story not covered because the victims names were not Abdul or Rehman? Because the suspects were not Muslims and Christians. Only matters which belong to diverse religions are to be heard for and others which don’t involve communalism should be left unheard. Even then the attackers were alleged to be Muslims but the allegations did not turn out to be true. After all these the Indian government still claims itself to be secular!</p>



<p><strong>The political blame game.</strong></p>



<p>The most common game in our country which politicians play against each other is the ‘blame game’ which was battled among the players of the party in power and the opposition party about who can howl more about the failure of the other but do nothing by self in return. Similarly in this case, every other party including the BJP blamed the Thackeray government and asked for an intensive investigation into the matter so as to prove the impotency of the Maharashtrian government in handling the case.</p>



<p><strong>Negligence on part of the police force.</strong></p>



<p>After the incident several videos surfaced in which the negligence of the police personnels were evident and this led to high criticisms by the public of the country as people were terrified by the acts of the villagers and were in shock to see that the police who is encumbered with the duty of protection had handed over one of the saints to the murderous mob while he was clinching the policeman’s hand to save him and the police clearly to failed to provide them with protection.</p>



<p><strong>The mystery behind the death of the lawyer appointed for the deceased.</strong></p>



<p>The entire incident did not only end with the lynching of the trio but also the matter which came into light when their lawyer, Digvijay Trivedi, who was to represent the sadhus, appointed by the Viswa Hindu Mahasabha<sup><a href="#post-26011-footnote-7">[8]</a></sup> on his way to the Dahanu district court, Palghar to see the accused who were in remand succumbed to an accident on the Mumbai- Ahemdabad highway. This was again a mystery as the deceased’s father raised concern that he was astonished, stating that the lawyer was good at driving and in years never obtained a scratch on his car<sup><a href="#post-26011-footnote-8">[9]</a></sup>!</p>



<p>This is not the first incident in India where saints have been killed and silence was observed. No one cared or felt responsible to discuss about it. In 2008, in the infamous Temple Sadhus Case, one ascetic was killed as he got several cow smugglers arrested, there were hardly any news over it. It could be definitely said that none of us is aware of the double murder of the seers that occurred in Nanded, Maharashtra<sup><a href="#post-26011-footnote-9">[10]</a></sup> which happened within two months from the Palghar Lynching but has still lagged attention.</p>



<p>The entire incident outlines an irony that the pandemic to be dealt with calls for solidarity and not separation. Sadhus still being a minority in our country needs to be respected and deserve as much justice as any other community. The news channels who claim to cover all the events which the public needs to know should capture it diligently without being religion biased and the great leaders must ponder over things which are more than just promotion of propaganda to collect votes and not choose to remain silent selectively on matters which would not fetch them seats in the upcoming elections. Lastly the principle ‘justice delayed is justice denied’ must also be followed in a case including so much of brutality as the families of the deceased await justice.</p>
