<p style="text-align:justify">With the recoveries of 57,989 COVID patients in the last 24 hours, the total number of recoveries has reached 22,80,566 today. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India’s total recoveries now exceed the total active cases (7,07,668) by nearly 16 lakhs (1,572,898).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As the graph shows, the average daily number of recoveries is on a constant upward move from 15,018 (1-7 July 2020) to 60,557 during the week of 19-13 August 2020.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The constantly increasing recoveries have ensured that the actual caseload of the country viz. the active cases, has reduced and currently comprises only 23.24% of the total positive cases. This has also resulted in gradually falling mortality rate. Currently at 1.86%, India’s Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is one of the lowest globally. It has been made possible because by comprehensive and sustained effectiveness of the Centre’s policy of TESTING aggressively, TRACKING comprehensively &#038; TREATING efficiently. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Higher number of recoveries and declining mortality rate among COVID patients have shown that India&#8217;s graded and pro-active strategies are delivering results on the field.</p>
