<p style="text-align:justify">i)        FRP of sugarcane for 2020-21 sugar season at Rs.285/- per quintal for a basic recovery rate of 10%;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">ii)       a premium of Rs. 2.85 per quintal for every 0.1% increase above 10% in the recovery; and                                                                                           </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">iii)      reduction in FRP by Rs. 2.85 per quintal for every 0.1 percentage point decrease in recovery, in respect of those mills whose recovery is below 10% but above 9.5 percent. However, for mills having recovery 9.5 % or below, the FRP is fixed at Rs 270.75 per quintal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The determination of FRP will be in the interest of sugarcane growers keeping in view their entitlement to a fair and remunerative price for their produce.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The ‘Fair and Remunerative price’ of sugarcane is determined under Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1966.  This will be uniformly applicable all over the country.</p>
