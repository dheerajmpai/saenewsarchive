<p style="text-align:justify">As per a statement issued by NTPC Ltd, the newly constructed 670 meter longest bridge in South Western railway is beneficial to NTPC Kudgi as it helps in reducing the cost of generation of electricity and it also helps the railways by handling more material with the available infrastructure. Besides, with the availability of double lines, travel time from Sholapur in Maharashtra to Gadag in Karnataka will be reduced, saving time for the passengers. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">NTPC has provided assistance on doubling of the lines on the existing tracks from Hotgi, Maharashtra to Kudgi, Karnataka (134 Kms) and provided support in the construction of two bridges on the river Bhima.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Currently, a bridge of more than 50-years restricts haulage of heavy loaded goods, whereby most of the traffic is being diverted through the Guntakal to Bellary-Gadag route. NTPC is awaiting for the final approval from the South Western Railway and will start the operations as soon as it gets clearance.</p>
