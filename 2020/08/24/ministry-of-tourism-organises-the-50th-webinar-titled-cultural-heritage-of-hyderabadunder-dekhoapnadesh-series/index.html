<p style="text-align:justify">Ms. Vottery explained how, Hyderabad is popularly known as the &#8220;City of Pearls&#8221; and the &#8220;City of Nizams&#8221;, and has been the centre of a vibrant historical legacy, ever since its inception by the QutubShahi dynasty. The city was later  conquered by Mughal Empire and finally falling in the hands of AsafJahi dynasty. The presenter spoke about the  influence of how the royal past shines even today in the culture of Hyderabad, food and iconic architectural structures such as Charminar and Golkonda Fort which stand as testaments to the city&#8217;s glorious history. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Recounting the history of the city, the presenter introduced the participants to history of the city .  Muhammad QuliQutb Shah established Hyderabad in 1591 to extend the capital beyond the fortified Golconda. In 1687, the city was annexed by the Mughals. In 1724, Mughal governor NizamAsaf Jah I declared his sovereignty and founded the AsafJahi dynasty, also known as the Nizams. Hyderabad served as the imperial capital of the AsafJahis from 1769 to 1948. As capital of the princely state of Hyderabad, the city housed the British Residency and cantonment until Indian independence in 1947.</p>

By the end of early modern era, the Mughal Empire declined in the Deccan and the Nizams&#8217; patronage had attracted men of letters from different parts of the world. The amalgamation of local and migrated artisans had originated a distinctive culture, and the city emerged as the foremost centre of oriental culture.  Painting, handicraft, jewellery, literature, dialect and clothing are prominent still today.  The Telugu film industry based in the city is the country&#8217;s second-largest producer of motion pictures.Hyderabad has been selected as a creative city in the category of gastronomy by UNESCO.</p>
