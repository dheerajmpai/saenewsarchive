<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Subodh Kumar Singh, Joint Secretary (Sugar &#038; Administration), DoFPD also addressed the programme and called upon the sugar factories to take up ethanol production by utilizing sugarcane juice, syrup and B heavy molasses etc. to boost up ethanol availability for Ethanol Blending Programme and balance sugar production-demand scenario. He said that against the ethanol blending target of 10%, we are still into 5% blending only and as ethanol market is assured, its production can help sugar factories in improving their financial conditions. It is in the larger interest of the nation being clean and green fuel, for attaining energy security and conserving foreign exchange required for import of crude oil, he added. </p>
