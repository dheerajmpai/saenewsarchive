Venkaiah Naidu wished people on the eve of Ganesh Chaturthi in a message.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The following is the full text of the message:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of our country on the auspicious occasion of ‘Ganesh Chaturthi’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Lord Ganesha who is believed to be the younger son of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati, is revered as an embodiment of wisdom, prosperity and good fortune.  We invoke Lord Ganesha and seek his blessings to remove obstacles in our path before we begin anything new.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Ganesh Chaturthi is a 10-day long festival that marks the birth of Lord Ganesha. The festivities often witness huge gatherings and processions of devotees.  Every year, people bring splendid idols of Lord Ganesha into their homes and worship the deity with utmost devotion and piety. The Visarjan of the idols, that symbolizes the journey of Lord Ganesha to Kailasa takes place on the 10th day, marking the end of the festival.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Though huge processions and gatherings are the hallmark of Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations, this year, we must strive to tone down the celebrations in view of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. I urge fellow citizens to strictly adhere to COVID-19 physical distancing protocols and maintain good hygiene while celebrating the festival.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">May this Ganesh Chaturthi bring peace, harmony and prosperity in our country. </p>
