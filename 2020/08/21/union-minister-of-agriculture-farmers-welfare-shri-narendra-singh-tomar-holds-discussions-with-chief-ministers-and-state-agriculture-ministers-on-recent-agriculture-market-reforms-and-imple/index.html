<p style="text-align:justify">During the discussions, Shri Tomar emphasized that it has to be ensured that full benefit of the Rs. 1 lakh crore Agri Infrastructure Fund reaches the small and medium farmers who comprise more than 85% of the total farmers in the country. He said that the Prime Minister has allocated such a large fund for the farmers, which is a historical step. The Union Agriculture Minister said that the new ordinances brought in by the government are totally farmer-welfare oriented and there is no need to get misled on the issue of Minimum Support Price. Procurement from farmers on the basis of MSP will continue as before. The Chief Ministers and State Agriculture Ministers gave full assurance that no stone will be left unturned in ensuring utilization of the Rs 1 lakh crore fund, and new infrastructure will be created in all the villages.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Union Minister shared the aspirational vision for agriculture under “Atmanirbhar Bharat”, highlighting the focus on transforming farmers into entrepreneurs and doubling farmers’ incomes. He noted the various reforms and schemes launched by the Government to strengthen the vision for the agriculture sector, including the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund, the Scheme for Facilitation and Promotion of 10,000 FPOs, three recent Ordinances, and benefits released under PM-KISAN and KCC for the farmers. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Tomar said that farmers are going to benefit greatly from the Ordinances of the Central Government. Contract farming and cluster farming will increase the income of farmers. For formation of 10,000 FPOs under the scheme, a provision of 6865 crore has been made under which 85 percent small farmers will be benefited. These FPOs will have a big role in terms of increasing the production and productivity of small farmers. Collective facilities like irrigation, fertilizer and seeds etc will reduce the cost of cultivation. Discussions will be held with States in the next round of meetings.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Mr. Vivek Agrawal, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers welfare made a presentation of the plan, and suggested to create a Project Management Unit in the States. The Agriculture Infrastructure Fund is a medium &#8211; long term debt financing facility for investment in viable projects for post-harvest management infrastructure and community farming assets through interest subvention and credit guarantee. The duration of the scheme shall be from FY2020 to FY2029 (10 years).

The scheme will support farmers, PACS, FPOs, agri-entrepreneurs, etc. in building community farming assets and post-harvest agriculture infrastructure. These assets will enable farmers to get greater value for their produce as they will be able to store and sell at higher prices, reduce wastage, and increase processing and value addition.
