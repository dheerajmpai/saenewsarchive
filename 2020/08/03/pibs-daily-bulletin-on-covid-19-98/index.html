<p style="text-align:justify">The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) has given approval to Serum Institute of India, Pune to conduct Phase II+III clinical trials of Oxford University-Astra Zeneca COVID-19 vaccine (COVISHIELD) in India. This will hasten the development of the COVID-19 vaccine. India continues to improve the Case Fatality Rate (CFR), and maintain its global position of having one of the lowest COVID fatalities rates. With a further fall, the current CFR touched 2.11% today. India has seen more than 40,574 patients recovered in the last 24 hours. This takes the total recoveries to 11,86,203 and Recovery Rate to 65.77% amongst COVID-19 patients. With improving daily recovery number, the gap between the recovered cases &#038; the active cases has increased to more than 6 lakh. Presently, it is 6,06,846. This means the actual active case load is 5,79,357 and all are under medical supervision. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has issued Revised Guidelines for International Arrivals </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">In a landmark achievement, India has tested 2,02,02,858 COVID-19 samples so far. With 3,81,027 samples tested in the last 24 hours, the number of Test Per Million (TPM) has increased to 14640.  While the country&#8217;s TPM has demonstrated a steady upward trend indicating the growing testing network, 24 States and UTs have reported higher testing per million than the national average. The testing lab network in the country is continuously strengthened with 1348 labs in the country; 914 labs in the government sector and 434 private labs. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network (eVIN) is an innovative technological solution, aimed at strengthening immunization supply chain systems across the country. This is being implemented under National Health Mission by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. eVIN aims to provide real-time information on vaccine stocks and flows, and storage temperatures across all cold chain points in the country. This robust system has been used with the requisite customization during the COVID pandemic for ensuring continuation of the essential immunization services and protecting children and pregnant women against vaccine preventable diseases. eVIN combines state-of-the-art technology, a strong IT infrastructure and trained human resource to enable real time monitoring of stock and storage temperature of the vaccines kept in multiple locations across the country. eVIN has reached 32 States and Union Territories (UTs) and will soon be rolled-out in the remaining States and UTs. To support the Government of India’s efforts to combat COVID-19, eVIN India is helping the State/UT governments monitor the supply chain of COVID response material. Since April 2020, eight States (Tripura, Nagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab and Maharashtra) are using the eVIN application with 100% adherence rate to track State specific COVID-19 material supplies, ensure availability and raise alerts in case of shortage of 81 essential drugs and equipment. This strong platform has the potential to be leveraged for any new vaccine including COVID-19 vaccine, as and when available.</p>
