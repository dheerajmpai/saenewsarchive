<p style="text-align:justify">In a testament to the determined, focussed, consistent and coordinated efforts of the Centre and the State/UT governments, India has conducted 1 million tests in the past 24 hours. With 10,23,836 tests done yesterday, India has achieved its resolve to test 10 lakh samples daily.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">With this achievement, the cumulative tests are more than 3.4 crore (3,44,91,073).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The number of daily tests has been increasing in a steep climb. Average daily tests during the past three weeks also strongly depict the progress made in enhancement of COVID-19 tests across the country.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As has been reported from States/UTs that have pushed ahead with aggressive testing, there is a commensurate decline in the positivity rate. Although higher number of tests will initially lead to a rise in the positivity rate, it will eventually lower when combined with other measures such as prompt isolation, efficient tracking, and timely effective and clinical management.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Combined with enhanced testing, policy decisions of the Centre and the States/UTs have facilitated easy testing across the country. This has boosted the daily testing capacity. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Enhanced diagnostic lab network has also sided in this achievement. Today, the country has a strong network of 1511 labs comprising 983 labs in the government sector and 528 private labs. These include: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">• Real-Time RT PCR based testing labs: 778 (Govt: 458 + Private: 320)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">• TrueNat based testing labs: 615 (Govt: 491 + Private: 124)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">• CBNAAT based testing labs: 118 (Govt: 34 + Private: 84)</p>
