Users who wish to claim a discount for making return journey within 24 hours or any other local exemptions, shall be required to have a valid functional FASTag on the vehicle. A Gazette notification no. 534 E dated 24th August, 2020 to amend the National Highways Fee (Determination of Rates and Collection) Rules, 2008  has been notified in this respect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This is another step towards promoting the use of digital payments on Fee Plazas of NHs. The fee payable towards such discounts shall be paid through pre-paid instruments, smart card or through FASTag or on board unit (transponder) or any other such device only.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The amendments to the Rules would enable-   </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">i.  For discount on return journey within 24 hours, it would be through FASTag or such other device and automatic and no requirement for a pass.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">ii.  For discounts on all other cases, having a valid FASTag is made necessary.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The amendment would also enable that in cases where there is a discount available for a return journey within 24 hours, there is no need for a prior receipt or intimation and the citizen would get the discount automatically if return journey is made within 24 hours with a valid and a functional FASTag on the vehicle.  </p>
