This takes the cumulative testing to 2,08,64,750 samples and the Tests per Million (TPM) to 15,119.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The combined and focused efforts of Union and State/UT Governments have resulted in ramped up testing across the country aimed at early detection and isolation of COVID-19 positive cases. The evolving ICMR’s testing strategy has widened the testing net in India. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">WHO in its Guidance Note on “Public Health Criteria to Adjust Public Health and Social Measures in the Context of COVID-19” has advised comprehensive surveillance for suspected cases. WHO advises that a country needs 140 tests per day per million population.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">While India conducts 479 tests/day/million on an average, there are 28 States/UTs in India which are conducting more than 140 tests/day/million, prescribed by WHO. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The focused strategy based on the “Test, Track and Treat” approach focuses on reducing the Positivity Rate of COVID-19 tests. India’s average positivity rate stands at 8.89%, as on date. There are 28 States/UTs which have positivity less than 10% which indicates that the testing strategy is on the right track. The effort of Centre and State/UT governments is to further improve the Positivity Rate to 5%.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">With the aim to conduct 10 lakh tests daily, the testing capacity is being continuously ramped up. The testing lab network in the country currently stands at a total of 1356 labs in the country; 917 labs in the government sector and 439 private labs. These include:</p>
