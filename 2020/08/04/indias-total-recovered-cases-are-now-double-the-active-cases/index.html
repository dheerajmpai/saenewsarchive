This has taken the recovery rate among COVID-19 patients to 66.31%. Coordinated implementation of COVID-19 management strategy by the Union and State/UT governments and selfless sacrifice of all frontline health workers has ensured that the recoveries are continuously on the rise. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The active cases (5,86,298) account for 31.59% of total positive cases and all are under medical supervision.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Effective containment, aggressive testing and standardized clinical management protocols based on a holistic Standard of Care approach continues to result in a progressively reducing Case Fatality Rate (CFR). India has registered the lowest CFR since the first lockdown at 2.10% as compared to the global average. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The mortality analysis of the present data shows that 50% of deaths have happened in the age group of 60 years and above; 37% deaths belong to 45 to 60 years age group; while 11% deaths belong to 26-44 years age group. This clearly highlights the people above the age of 45 belong to the high-risk group and country’s containment strategy is focusing on this group. In the gender wise distribution, 68% of people who died were men and 32% were women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India has taken timely and graded measures to ensure availability of ventilators since the start of COVID-19 pandemic which had resulted in a spike in demand all across the world. India decided to encourage domestic supply of ventilators under ‘Make In India’ as 75% of the market depended on import and import restrictions were increasing along with the severity of the pandemic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">To meet the projected requirement of 60,000 ventilators in the country, the Committee of Technical Experts under Director General of Health Services (DGHS) under the Ministry of Health &#038; Family Welfare prescribed the Minimum Essential Specifications for the basic ventilators to be procured for COVID-19 purposes after due and extensive deliberation. The Empowered Group (EG) -3 was constituted for addressing the issue of essential medical supplies. After careful physical demonstration and clinical validation of the domestic ventilator model, orders were placed. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Major orders were placed upon two Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs) &#8211; Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) and Andhra Med-Tech Zone (AMTZ). In addition, the automobile industry also stepped up along with Defence research and Development Organisation (DRDO). As of now, the ‘Make in India’ ventilators have a market share more than 96% by volume and more than 90% by value. As on date, they have been installed at more than 700 hospitals. In less than two months, more than 18000 ventilators have been supplied to States/ UTs/ Central Govt. Hospitals/ DRDO facility.</p>
