Venkaiah Naidu has wished the people on the auspicious occasion of Id-ul-Zuha.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Following is the full text of the message &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of our country on the auspicious occasion of Id-ul-Zuha.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Id-ul-Zuha is a celebration of unswerving devotion to God and the boundless compassion and love the Almighty has for His creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The festival inspires us to inculcate empathy, practice sacrifice and promote peace and universal brotherhood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As India and the world continue to fight a relentless battle against the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, we have been forced to celebrate almost all of our traditional festivals, which were otherwise celebrated with great splendour, at home in a more subdued manner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Under these circumstances, we have to be content with a modest celebration and strictly adhere to the safety protocols of wearing masks, practicing physical distancing and personal hygiene during all our celebrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">May this Id-ul-Zuha bring peace, harmony and prosperity in our lives, country and the world.”</p>
