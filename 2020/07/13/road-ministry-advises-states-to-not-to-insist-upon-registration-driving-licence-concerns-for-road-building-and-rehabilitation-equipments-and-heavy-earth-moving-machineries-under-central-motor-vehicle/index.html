<p style="text-align:justify">The representation regarding Heavy Earth Moving Machineries (HEMM) &#8211; wherein concern regarding registration of  HEMM equipment and their operation has been raised. HEMM such as Dumpers, Payloaders, Shovels, Drill Master, Bulldozers, Motor Grader and Rock breakers are also categorised as  &#8220;OFF THE ROAD&#8221;  operated  and maintained within mine boundary under sole management, supervision and control of Mines Manager and never used outside mine boundary. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Ministry&#8217;s communication draws attention to section 2 (28) of  the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 for  the definitfon of a Motor Vehicle, which says a Motor Vehicle means any mechanically propelled vehicle adapted for use upon roads whether the power of propulsion is transmitted  thereto from an external  or internal source and indudes a chasis to which a body has not been attached and a trailed;  but does not include a vehicle running upon fixed rails or a vehicle  of a special  type adapted  for use only in  a factory or  in any other enclosed premises or a vehicle having less than four wheels fitted with engine capacity of not exceeding twenty-five cubic centimeters.</p>
