<p style="text-align:justify">Some states have launched innovative mobile apps and portals as means to facilitate remote learning. Madhya Pradesh has launched Top Parent App, a free mobile app that empowers parents of young children (3-8 years) with knowledge and strategies around child development to help them meaningfully engage with their children.

Education through Whatsapp is also being dispensed in Punjab, Puducherry.

For students with special needs, the campaign has been named as “Hum Kisi se Kam Nahi- Mera Ghar Meri Pathshala&#8221;. The content is being shared through WhatsApp groups where special educators are assigned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Many states have had to be creative with low tech forms of teaching and instruction delivery with low or nil requirements of the internet. For instance- In Arunachal Pradesh, primary class students are receiving interesting Radio talks in their mother tongue through All India Radio, Itanagar. The districts of Jharkhand have localized actual teachers addressing children through regional Doordarshan and available radio slots. Similar is Puducherry’s initiative telecasting the classes through virtual control rooms on local TV channels. Manipur has started comic books for students of class 3-5 to help them learn concepts in a fun way. Ladakh is collaborating with NGOs like EMBIBE Bangalore and 17000 feet in providing online education to students even in low connectivity zones. The missing element during the current crisis being ‘community engagement’, the idea of localized and personalized resources have come into picture. Popular features like quiz competitions are held by the state of Haryana. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">To grapple with the challenges of providing remote learning, NIOS &#038; Swayam Prabha contents are disseminated focusing on children who are not connected to the internet and have limited access to radio &#038; TV. The initiatives from states to make available the content through innovative mediums are ensuring inclusion. For instance &#8211; Andhra Pradesh has started Toll Free Call Centre and Toll Free Video call centre for students for understanding critical topics and clearing their doubts. Due to poor mobile connectivity and unavailability of internet services, Chhattisgarh has started Motor iskool. The state has also started a toll free number as VFS (Virtual Field Support).

West Bengal has also started an exclusive and dedicated toll-free helpline number to enable students to call and clarify doubts. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">To ensure inclusive learning in remote areas where internet connectivity and electricity is poor and sporadic, States and UTs have also distributed textbooks at children’s doorsteps. Some of the states that have taken this initiative to reach students are Odisha, Madhya Pradesh (under Dakshata Unnayan Programme), Dadra &#038; Nagar Haveli and Daman &#038; Diu, etc. Lakshadweep has distributed tablets equipped with e-contents to students. Nagaland has distributed study material through DVD/Pen drive to students at nominal cost. Jammu &#038; Kashmir has distributed free tabs to students, along with laptops &#038; Braille tactile readers for visually impaired learners. </p>

Goa has partnered with Embibe, an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered online platform for learning, practicing, and testing, for students preparing for entrance exams in the State. Karnataka has launched Pariksha Vani, an exam preparation program through Doordarshan, and an SSLC Exam Readiness Program.

Similarly, other states are also focusing on mental well-being of students like Tamil Nadu and Telangana.
