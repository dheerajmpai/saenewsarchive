The SG pillar entails energy data management, energy modelling and collaboration on low carbon technologies as three key activities. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In the joint working group meeting of the Sustainable Growth Pillar on July 2, 2020, an India Energy Modeling Forum was launched.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">There exist energy modelling forums in different parts of the World. The Energy Modelling Forum (EMF) in USA was established in 1976 at Stanford University to connect leading modelling experts and decision makers from government, industry, universities, and other research organizations. The forum provides an unbiased platform to discuss the contemporary issues revolving around energy and environment. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In India, there was no formalized and systematic process of having a modeling forum. Even then, various think-tanks/research organizations like TERI, IRADe, CSTEP, CEEW, NCAER, etc., have been consistently developing scenarios and contributing through modelling studies and analyses to provide required inputs to MoEF&#038;CC and other relevant ministries, including NITI Aayog.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The India Energy Modelling Forum will accelerate this effort and aim to:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> NITI Aayog will initially coordinate the activities of the forum and finalizing its governing structure. The forum would include knowledge partners, data agencies and concerned government ministries.</p>
