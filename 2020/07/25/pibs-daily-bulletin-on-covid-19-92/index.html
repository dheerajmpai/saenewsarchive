<p style="text-align:justify">For the first time, a record number of more than 4,20,000 COVID tests have been conducted in a single day. This elevated number comes on the heels of 3,50,000 tests having been done very day consistently over the last one week.

A strong factor contributing to this achievement is the persistent increase in the number of labs from merely one in January 2020 to 1301 today. Mortality due to COVID-19 has significantly dipped to 2.35% today. India has one of the lowest fatality rates in the world. 32,223 COVID patients have recovered in the last 24 hours. The cumulative number of recovered cases has reached 8,49,431 today. The recovery rate has achieved another high of 63.54%. The gap between recovered patients and active COVID-19 cases has further increased to 3,93,360. </p>
