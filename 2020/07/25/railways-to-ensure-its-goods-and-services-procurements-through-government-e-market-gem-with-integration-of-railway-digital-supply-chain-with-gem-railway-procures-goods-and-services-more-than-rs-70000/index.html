<p style="text-align:justify">Indian Railways, one of the largest procurement agencies of the Government of India, is integrating its procurement systems with GeM to use GeM’s full potential. The department shared the timelines for integration of Indian Railway e-Procurement system with GeM. Railway emphasised the need to have a seamless integration of the two systems eliminating need for any manual interface. Strength of both the systems i.e. Railways IREPS and GeM should be productively leveraged to generate synergy to take the Railways procurement to GeM’s full potential.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Post integration GeM is intended to move further in the direction of becoming single point public procurement portal for all agencies of Government of India.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">During the meeting ways and means to create a corruption free public procurement environment in India were discussed in which Ministry of Railways, DPIIT and GeM have extremely important roles to play.The need for engagement of industry for developing more indigenous vendors to participate in the growth journey of the Indian Railways was emphasised in the deliberations. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">During the presentation, It was decided that Railways would work more towards having a user-friendly single step vendor web based interface for all its activities. The website should, transparently, provide every interested vendor a clear idea of how to do business with Indian Railways. The website should have all relevant information to generate confidence of corruption free and transparent environment on Indian Railways.     </p>
