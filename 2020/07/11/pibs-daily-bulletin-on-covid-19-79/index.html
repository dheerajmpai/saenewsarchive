<p style="text-align:justify">Standard of care for Clinical Management Strategy for COVID-19</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The approach for treatment of COVID-19 is largely based on asymptomatic and supportive care, since there is no cure as yet.  Maintaining good hydration is also essential.  Based on severity of symptoms, COVID-19 can be categorised into 3 groups: mild, moderate and severe.  In a Video Conference with States on 10.07.2020 and a virtual meeting on “COVID Case Management by State / UT Centres of Excellence”, ICMR and AIIMS, New Delhi emphasised the theme that in the absence of a cure, the standard of care treatment for mild, moderate and severe cases as described in the Clinical Management Protocol of Ministry of Health &#038; Family Welfare (MoHFW), would be most effective.  All the ‘investigational therapies’ are required to be carried out only in proper health care facilities where close monitoring of patients is possible so that potential complications can be managed.  </p>
