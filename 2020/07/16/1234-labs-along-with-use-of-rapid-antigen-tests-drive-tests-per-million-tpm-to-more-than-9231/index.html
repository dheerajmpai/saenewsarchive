As a result, there has been a steady rise in the number of testing labs across the country. The increased testing is in accordance with the ICMR Guidelines and has helped in early detection of cases.  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The testing includes the RT-PCR which is the golden standard of the COVID-19 testing. This has been augmented with Rapid Antigen Point of Care (POC) Testing that gives results within half-hour. This has resulted in ramped up testing in the Containment and Buffer Zones. This has significantly helped in controlling the spread of the infection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">All registered medical practitioners can now recommend testing. This coupled with the facilitation of widespread testing by States/UTs through the RT-PCR, TrueNat and CBNAAT lab network has contributed to a surge in the number of samples tested.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">3,26,826 samples have been tested in the last 24 hours. The cumulative number of 1,27,39,490 samples tested translated to a figure of 9231.5 testing per million for India.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The testing lab network in the country is further strengthened with 1234 labs in the country; 874 labs in the government sector and 360 private labs. These include:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">• Real-Time RT PCR based testing labs: 635 (Govt: 392 + Private: 243)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">• TrueNat based testing labs: 499 (Govt: 447 + Private: 52)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">• CBNAAT based testing labs: 100 (Govt: 35 + Private: 65)</p>
