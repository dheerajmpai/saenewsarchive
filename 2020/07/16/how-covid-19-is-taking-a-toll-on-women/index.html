Lockdown, right? And how this has completely changed the definition of our normal lives. Many of us feel that our lives have been put to a halt, but this might not be true for the gender that is expected to work more than on normal days. The gender that clearly has no holidays, the gender that is managing the household chores, the office work, the kids and is yet facing a high risk of being abused at home.</p>
<p>Most of us already know which gender I am talking about, but just for the sake of clarity, I’d like to specify that women since ages have been facing the worst brunt of the crisis be it a war or a pandemic the gender is made to carry the burden of it. The worst of all we don’t even need a crisis to make women’s life difficult. Women even without a crisis are not safe on roads, at public places, at offices, not even in their own homes.&nbsp; There are numerous ways used by men to show their superiority and domination over women. Ever-increasing cases of eve-teasing, sexual harassment, rape, domestic violence are signs of how our society has failed to patriarchy. This is the reason why many women are not allowed or don’t want to step out, but the lockdown has shown that not going out is not a solution to women&#8217;s atrocities.</p>
<p>The lockdown is taking a toll on women as there are no house helps. Working women are sacrificing their sleep and mental health for their professional and emotional commitments. The condition of housewives is no better, as the husband and children are at home most of the time and are creating a stressful environment for women. Women during lockdown are not getting the much-needed break and are working on their toes. In addition to this in many households, women are also being subjected to violence and abuse at their own homes by their own members of the family. The abusers in majority of cases are their own husbands.</p>
<p>There has been a sudden rise in domestic violence cases in India. People are requested to stay at home and women in some cases are requested to stay under the same roof as their abusers. Requesting people to stay at home is the need of the hour, but while dealing with one crisis we are actually giving way to another equally dangerous crisis i.e. domestic violence. Earlier, the women used to get a sigh of relief whenever their husbands/abusers used to step out of home and were able to file complaints against the same. Most of the cases are going unreported as the cases are from low-income families and they don’t have many resources to go against their abusers and lodge a complaint. Women in the upper class generally are averse to the idea of filing complaints against their own family members due to different reasons, and now more so because of the 24*7 presence of their husbands. From the start of the lockdown to April 30, the Women Commission had received less than 60 complaints, and mostly my emails or in the mailbox. Filing a complaint by a source where they can get caught can further aggravate the difficulties for them. Women can’t even step out of the home to go and take action against their husbands. Women who do not have access to telephone or any other means of communication with 100% surety of not being overheard are finding it difficult to take action against their abusers. They are trying to take the help of their relatives, but that’s not enough.</p>
<p>The current scenario is affecting the mental health of the people throughout leading to anxiety, depression, frustration etc. People are frustrated because of economic instability and the uncertainty prevailing throughout the nation and the world. The pandemic is meddling with everyone’s mental health irrespective of gender, but the men of the nation have found a way of dealing with their frustration by taking it out on the women. Women according to most of the men in India are below them and the men for being a part of the patriarchal society get a right to treat women in the way they want. And even if some of the educated men of India aren’t hitting or abusing their women sexually, they aren’t treating them in the way the women should be treated. Domestic violence can be in any form, verbal, sexual, or physical. Being confined in a space with dominating or manipulative people could further accelerate the rates and the intensity of dangers, physical, sexual, and mental maltreatment, humiliation, terrorizing, and controlling conduct. The capacity to isolate an individual from loved ones, monitoring and controlling their movements, and restricting access to financial resources, business openings, instruction, or clinical consideration has increased by the lockdown. These practices significantly affect the individuals, and can also influence emotional well-being and prosperity.</p>
<p>Now just take a pause and think of women around you who have never faced this. You’ll be shocked at the number of women you can think of who have never been subjected to any kind of abuse, and that’s really appalling.</p>
<p>The NCW chairperson believes that the real figure is likely to be higher, since the bulk of complaints come from women who send their complaints by post, and might not be able to use the internet. Between the beginning of March and April 5th, the NCW received 310 grievances of domestic violence and&nbsp;<a href="http://164.100.58.238/frmComp_Stat_Overview.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">885</a>&nbsp;complaints about other forms of violence against women, many of which are domestic in nature—such as bigamy, polygamy, dowry deaths, and harassment for dowry. However, the numbers of cases reported are not proportional to the number of cases happening. Domestic violence cases have been increasing since the lockdown was announced and to deal with this the National Commission of Women has launched a Whatsapp number (7217735372) to deal specifically with domestic violence complaints, this is in addition to the already existing complaint links and emails.</p>
<p>The authorities are taking actions to deal with the situation, but Domestic violence as an issue requires more attention from the government. The government needs to prioritize the issue and should see it in the light of its repercussions. The government should see it not just as an act of physical harm but should consider its impact on the mental, emotional, and physical well being of the victim. The authorities should include the ways to deal with Domestic violence while making the emergency plan for fighting against the pandemic. This requires a lot more awareness, and here we can make smart use of social media, newspapers, news channels, advertisements, etc. While creating awareness for hand washing and social distancing to deal with the pandemic, people can also be requested and can be made aware to fight against an already existing issue of domestic violence. People should be informed of all the measures they can take if they themselves are going through or are aware of the people going through domestic violence. It’s the responsibility of the government and the society to make victims feel that they are not alone in this fight, and it’s time they raised their voices. The government should also plan a monetary scheme or a preventive scheme for the victims who are living with their abusers only because they don’t have any other means of livelihood. If not financial help, the&nbsp;government can provide them with suitable job opportunities or send them to women-centric NGOs. Its time government considered this issue as important as any other national issue because making homes a safe place is the beginning of creating a safer nation.</p>
<p>However, it is&nbsp;not just the responsibility of the government, we as the people of the nation need to be cooperative with the authorities. Just framing of rules, laws &amp; schemes won’t change the fate of the women in our country. For instance, The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (Domestic Violence Act) was enacted in the year 2005 and even after years, the assurances made in the act have not fully come into fruition. The act talks about all kinds of violence and has an expansive scope, but the authorities i.e. police &amp; judiciary and the layman of the country are still not familiar with the idea of keeping women at an equal pedestal. They are still guided by their patriarchal thought process and are really stubborn to have it any other way.</p>
<p>Domestic violence can best be described as a thought process, which makes abusers feel that hitting people who you think are physically not as strong as you are, is okay. They feel that they can dominate and can take their frustration out on the victims. You only hit/abuse people who you think are weaker than you. Fight against domestic violence is not as easy as framing a law, we need to transform the way our society thinks, form the topmost ministers to the people living in poverty, from the senior citizens of our nation to the toddlers, we need to inculcate a sense of equality amongst them for all the people of the nation irrespective of their gender. It’s not a fight of women against the society it’s a fight of the society against the society, and the toughest fights are the ones you fight against yourself. Every crisis has the potential to change the future of the nation, and this pandemic can prove to be a game-changer for our society. If we really want to fight against inequality, now is the time. We can come out of this pandemic as a stronger nation, as Dumbledore has rightly said, “Happiness can be found in darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.”</p>
<p>Having said this, I am not saying that all men are bad, but if most of the women have faced some kind of abuse at some point in their lives, there’s something wrong. If our women are not feeling safe even at their own home with their own family members, we as a society are failing. It’s time to take action against this; we as a nation can’t worsen the situation for our women in an already stressful situation, where we are all trying to fight against a pandemic.</p>
