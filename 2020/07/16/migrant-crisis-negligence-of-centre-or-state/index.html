<p>-Eugene V Debs</p>



<p>With the national lockdown of our country, due to the widespread of disease COVID-19, our people seem to have woken up to the plight of its internal migrants who work in many unknown and unorganized labour sectors. As the lockdown has caused the closures of countless sectors of our economy, resulting in unemployment of over 100 million of people around our country, the most affected ones who have lost their jobs are the migrant labours. Thousands of labours are migrating hundreds of miles to their homes with public transport laid off. Ones who remained on their working sites have been insulated in government shelters. This has resulted in an unusual migrant crisis where millions of working-class Indians want to reach their homes by any means or on any condition. We did not read social media posts or tweets from these hundreds and thousands of people. While the rest of the nation was ‘staying home, staying safe’, these workers were, in effect told, ‘stay on the streets, you are on your own’. These migrants are nothing more than some reckless people wandering around the streets or a debate material for much of the mainstream media. So far, over 130 migrants have died in accidents their home states.<sup><a href="#post-25456-footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></p>



<ul><li>“The nationwide lockdown in India, which started about a month ago, has impacted nearly 80 million internal migrants”, the World Bank said.<sup><a href="#post-25456-footnote-2">[2]</a></sup></li><li>“Around 50,000-60,000 moved from urban centres to rural areas of origin in the span of a few days”, The World bank said.<sup><a href="#post-25456-footnote-3">[3]</a></sup></li><li>16 migrant workers fell asleep on the railway tracks of Aurangabad and got crushed to death by a goods train on Friday, May 8 in the way of returning home to Madhya Pradesh from Maharashtra.<sup><a href="#post-25456-footnote-4">[4]</a></sup></li><li>In another incident, five migrant workers died and 13 got injured when the truck that carried them from Hyderabad and Telangana, to their homes in Uttar Pradesh, overturned on the night of Saturday, May 9.<sup><a href="#post-25456-footnote-5">[5]</a></sup></li></ul>



<p>The changes in our so called “perfect” labour laws has resulted various factors which only benefits the capitalists across the country. But the factors which have affected our labours are The inspection of factories, workplaces and the issue of licenses has been made easier, working hours of shifts have been increased from eight to 12 and deposing in firms working with 50 to 100 workers has been made easier. These changes have a time limit of three years and are clearly intended to aid capital which makes these changes worse.</p>



<p><strong>INITIATIVES</strong></p>



<p>The ministry of Railways has operated over 1074 Shramik Special trains which have deported over 1.4 million migrants to their native places across the country. This initiative has turned out to be quite succesfull, helping our workers to reach their families safely.</p>



<p>The central government has decided that food grains will be provided free of cost at the rate of 5 Kg per month for two months i.e. May and June 2020, to about 8 Crore migrant labour who are not covered under NFSA, State scheme PDS cards and ration cards. The total estimated cost of about Rs. 3500 Crore for implementation of this scheme will be fully borne by the Government of India.<sup><a href="#post-25456-footnote-6">[6]</a></sup> This great initiative taken by the government fulfils the appetite of the workers even in such a crisis. NGOs like The Working Peoples&#8217; Charter, Asha foundation, Uday foundations, Rise Against Hunger (RAHI) YUVA foundation, and many others are helping state and central government to feed and provide shelters in this crisis. The Centre has directed all states to quarantine migrant workers reaching their borders in temporary shelters for a mandatory two-week period after proper medical screening.</p>



<p><strong>CRITICISM</strong></p>



<p>Even though our governments are taking some initiatives to end this crisis, still it has exposed the long-term patterns and narratives of central and state government. It seems that our diligent workers are not aware of them is wrong and they have a right to protest and demand for repatriation services</p>



<p>In some states like Maharashtra, Kerala, and Karnataka, it is mandatory for migrant workers to have medical certificates to enter the trains. But the distressing truth is that one must register an medical online form (which indicates whether one is in a condition to travel) and then report to the nearest local police station to get a travel pass to reach the railway station. A worker needs to have a smart phone and his/her vital information to fulfil the needs of this form that many poor and illiterate workers may lack. The thing which makes this worse is that there are no specific authorities to help them.</p>



<p>Black marketing has increased drastically because of the negligence of various state government across the country. These state governments are accused for the exploitation of migrant workers. State governments were assigned the duty of monitoring the migrants (like providing food, shelters, and medical check-ups) in their respective states. But governments of states like Bihar, Maharashtra and Delhi are being criticized for their irresponsibility towards these factors. Interstate transportation is the responsibility of the state governments. But the governments are accused of yielding out their profits out of this transportation business.</p>



<p>India’s labour laws have always been criticized for being too complex. in 2018, The Central Government introduced a new bill called the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions which was aimed to include all 14 of the existing labour laws into a single legislation, including the Interstate Migrant Workmen Act, 1979. This bill never came into effect because of its strong criticism. This Labour crisis has amplified the need for the Ministry of Labour and Employment to draft a separate law for interstate migrant workers. These migrant workers are a group of most vulnerable workers who have lost their jobs, shelters, and food overnight. Therefore, it is the responsibility of our state and central governments to work together.</p>



<p>During this crisis, our governments, be it centre or state, are turning out to be quite irresponsible. Whenever our labours look up to our governments, the response they are given is that “it’s not our responsibility”. Their reckless behaviour towards the labour even before this pandemic has resulted in such a crisis. In this situation, our governments are considering this crisis as a ‘tennis match’ where the governments are players, and their “tennis ball” is our labour force.</p>



<p><strong>WHAT COULD BE THE PROBABLE SOLUTIONS?</strong></p>



<p>The only solution to this crisis is ‘Unity’. The unity of our central and all the state governments, capitalists and workers, forgetting all their differences, can bear such a fruit which would benefit not only our workers but countless capitalists or political leaders, ultimately ending such a crisis. Our ministry of labour and every labour state departments across the country should coordinate with each other by drafting a bill which is written with no complexity, with non-criticisable sections, and must include all workers from every section or sector, be it organised or unorganized. Not only our governments, but various capitalists are also accused for mass exploitation and extortion of the labours working in their firms. Therefore, capitalist across must understand their conditions and work together to end this crisis.</p>



<p>At last, the permanent solution to this problem is to relocate the sectors of our economy from urban to rural area. This process would lead to the development of our rural areas and the migrants who migrate from such areas. If capitalists would set up their factories and industries there, they will not have to pay the transportation charges because of the accessibility of raw materials, resources, and the presence of a large rural labour force, resulting in mass employment. This would eventually benefit migrants; in fact, they will not have to be called “migrants” as in our country most of the migrants belong to rural areas. If this happens, our economy might get a “super boost” making it a revolution and setting the path of our diligent and great workers to a very bright future.</p>
