However, there are some significant learnings and achievements that we have had during this period, which I would like to share.”</p>

India has successfully created awareness about the importance of staying fit through a series of dedicated online programmes for citizens on fitness and well-being, all through the pandemic. Experts have shared their advice on health, nutrition, exercises that citizens of all age groups has used successfully.” Ms. Patricia Scotland QC, Secretary General of the Commonwealth lauded this step by India as a unique initiative to fight the pandemic.</p>

I am happy to inform that the training of our elite, Olympic-bound athletes has begun in specialised camps, recently. I have also spoken to the sports ministers of all states and union territories, as well as the National Sports Federations and asked them to slowly resume some sporting events. We need that to boost the confidence of people. I am hopeful India will have sporting events from September or October, even the big leagues in various sports are considering resumption,” the Sports Minister said.</p>

Now, they are creating awareness about the new schemes that have been launched by the government to aid the poor in the unlock phase. The government has decided to give free ration to the poor of the country till November, and our volunteers are creating awareness in towns and remote villages about these schemes of the government that they can benefit from.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">While hailing the collaborative spirit of the commonwealth nations, Shri.

Though, these competitions will be held in India and not in the UK, but I still thank the committee for heeding India’s request and feel that this kind of accommodative attitude can strengthen the bond of the Commonwealth Nations.”</p>
