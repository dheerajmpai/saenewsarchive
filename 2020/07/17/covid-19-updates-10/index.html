India has seen a steady increase in the number of patients recovering of COVID. In the last 24 hours, 22,942 were cured and discharged.This has resulted in 63.33% of total positive cases recovering. 6,35,756 patients have recovered, till date. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">While the strategy to deal with the spread of infection remains focused on early detection with wide-spread and easily accessible testing, the intensive contact tracing is aimed at restricting the spread. The Containment Strategy implemented across the Containment and Buffer Zones stresses on house-to-house survey and surveillance of SARI/ILI patients with focus on the elderly and people with co-morbid conditions. This has ensured that the COVID cases are identified in a timely manner and treated as per the severity of the symptoms either at home or in hospitals. </p>
