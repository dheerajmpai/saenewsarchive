<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">Many important tasks like KYC attestation, transfer claim attestation etc are being done online by the authorized persons of employers using their Digital Signatures (DSC) or Aadhar based   e-Signs on EPFO portal. For using DSC/e-Sign, one time approval from Regional Offices is required. Due to lockdown, many employers are facing difficulties to send the one time registration requests to the Regional Offices.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">Keeping in view the above situation and to further ease the compliance procedure, EPFO has decided to accept such requests through email also. Employer can send the scanned copy of duly signed request letter to the concerned Regional Office through mail. Official email addresses of the Regional Offices are available at <a href="http://www.epfindia.gov.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.epfindia.gov.in</a> .</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">Further, such establishments, whose authorized officers have approved digital signatures but are not able to locate the dongle, can login to the employer portal and register their e-sign through the link for registration of already registered authorized signatories. If their name against the approved digital signature is same as that in their Aadhar, the registration of e-sign will not require any further approval. Other authorized signatories can register their e-signs and send the request letters approved by the employers and seek approval of the concerned EPFO Offices.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">This facility provides further relief to the employers and EPF members adversely impacted by the Pandemic. </span></p>
