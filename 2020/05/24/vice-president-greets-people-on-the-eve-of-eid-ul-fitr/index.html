Venkaiah Naidu has wished the nation on the eve of the auspicious occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr. Describing Eid as an occasion for families and communities to come together, he requested everyone to follow safety norms of social distancing during celebrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Following is the full text of the message &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of our country on the auspicious occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Eid-ul-Fitr has traditionally been a celebration that marks the end of the Holy month of Ramadan and the start of Shawwal, the 10th month of the Islamic calendar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The festival fortifies the spirit of compassion, charity and generosity in our society. It is an occasion for families and communities to come together.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">However, this year, as India and the world continue to fight the relentless battle against the spread of COVID-19, we are celebrating almost all our traditional festivals at home.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">So, we have to be content with a subdued celebration and adhere to the safety norms of social distancing and personal hygiene. Nevertheless, I do hope that all of us will celebrate the festival by keeping alive the spirit of joy, compassion and mutual respect that underlies the pious occasion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">May the noble ideals associated with Eid-ul-Fitr usher in health, peace, prosperity and harmony in our lives.”</p>
