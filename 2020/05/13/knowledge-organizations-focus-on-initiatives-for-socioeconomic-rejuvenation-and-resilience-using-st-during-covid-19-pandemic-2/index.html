<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">A mobile App based regular advisory to pregnant women has been initiated under already ongoing projects at AIIMS New Delhi. Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences &amp; Technology of Kashmir (SKAUST), Srinagar initiated a telemedicine facility for monitoring the health of farm animals under ongoing projects. In order to address breathing-related issues, a herbal decongestion spray on the principles of Ayurveda has been developed. More than 5000L of sanitizer has been distributed among migrant population at AIIMS-New Delhi, Safdurjung-New Delhi, Police Department of Haryana &amp;Punjab, and UP and the process is continuing towards the containment of disease. The technology of herbal sanitizer developed under the DST funded ongoing project has been transferred to companies for bulk production and sustaining the supply for public consumptions at an affordable rate, and the protocol has been shared with Voluntary Organizations for distribution at the local level.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">A Psychological First Aid-Epidemic (PFA-E) for COVID-19 to minimize psychosocial problems during an epidemic is under development using google form. Literature is being published related to COVID and psychosocial response by the community through authentic resources. A distancing-compatible farm work plan and movement strategy for farmworkers to minimize contact for different crops is being developed. Ready-to-use bio-surfactant-based formulation for hands and surface sanitization; a non-toxic, biocompatible, and cost-effective body wipes to fight against this deadly virus, and a prototype for sterilization using ozone Micro-Nano-Bubbles (MNBs) are being proposed and would be ready within 6 months.</span></p>
