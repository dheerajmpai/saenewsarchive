<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Shortage of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is of serious concern as it imperils the well-being and availability of the Healthcare Workforce, apart from adversely impacting their security and morale.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">The PPE is required to meet stringent criteria on testing and the benchmarks of the same are setby  the ICMR and the MoHFW. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">The Indian Navy has risen to this challenge of making available this critical resource in the fight against COVID. A team formed by the <strong>Innovation Cell, Institute of Naval Medicine, Mumbai</strong> and the <strong>Naval Dockyard Mumbai</strong> collaborated to design and produce PPE. The PPE has been tested by INMAS (Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences) Delhi, a DRDO organization tasked with the testing and certification of PPE.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">The PPE passed with 6/6 Synthetic blood penetration resistance test pressure. (GoI mandates minimum 3/6 and above level as per ISO 16603 standard) and is thus certified to be mass produced and used in clinical COVID situations.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">The outstanding features of the PPE are its simple, innovative and cost-effective design; thus it can be made by basic gown manufacturing facilities. The PPE is noteworthy for the innovative choice of fabric used, which gives the PPE its &#8216;breathability&#8217; and penetration resistance rendering it both comfortable and safe for the user.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">The cost for this PPE is significantly lower than those commercially available. </span></span></p>
