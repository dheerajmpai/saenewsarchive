The upgradation of navigational aids and infrastructure under this project would enhance the operational capability by facilitating air operations of military and civil aircrafts even in poor visibility and adverse weather condition while enhancing aerospace safety.</span></span></span></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:#000000"><span style="background-color:#ffffff"> </span></span></span></span></p>
