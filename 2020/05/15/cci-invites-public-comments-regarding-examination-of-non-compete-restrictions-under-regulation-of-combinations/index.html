Notifying parties are required to furnish information on non-compete restrictions for the purpose of its examination. The CCI has issued a Guidance Note explaining the circumstances under which a non-compete restriction would be regarded as ‘ancillary’ or ‘not ancillary’. The Guidance Note provides that 3 years of non-compete obligation is usually justified in case of transfer of goodwill and know-how and two years in case of transfer of goodwill alone. It further provides that the scope of non-compete shall be restricted to the business sold and the territory where it was conducted. However, a finding that the restriction is not ancillary does not raise any presumption of infringement under the provisions of the Act.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">It has been observed that prescribing a general set of standards for assessment of non-compete restrictions may not be appropriate in modern business environments. While it may be possible to conduct a detailed examination on case by case basis, the same may, however, not be feasible considering the timelines followed in combination cases.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">The CCI, therefore, proposes to omit paragraph 5.7 of Form I in the Combination Regulations<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'><span style="color:black">[1]</span></span></a> that seeks information regarding non-compete restrictions agreed between the parties to combination and justification for the same. This would allow the parties flexibility in determining non-compete restrictions, while also reducing the information burden on them. However, the parties will be responsible for ensuring that their non-compete arrangements are competition compliant. Competition concerns, if any, that may arise from non-compete restrictions can be looked into under Sections 3 and/ or 4 of the Act.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">AA copy of the draft amendment to the Combination Regulations is available on the website of the CCI (<a href="www.cci.gov.in">www.cci.gov.in</a> ). Comments are invited from the public and may be emailed to <a href="combination.cci@nic.in">combination.cci@nic.in</a> by June 15, 2020.</span></p>
