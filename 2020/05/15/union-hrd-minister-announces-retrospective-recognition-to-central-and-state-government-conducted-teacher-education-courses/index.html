<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"> NCTE legally grants formal recognition to academic institutions for conducting any of the NCTE recognized courses meant for pre-service teacher education.  It is only after qualifying any of these NCTE recognized courses that a person becomes legally eligible for appointment as a school teacher in India.  </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">It was brought to the notice of MHRD that some of the Central and State Govt institutions had inadvertently admitted students in teacher education courses which were not recognized by NCTE.  This rendered invalid the qualification acquired by these students for the purposes of employment as school teachers in India.  </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>Retrospective recognition to courses:</strong></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">An amendment to the NCTE Act, 1993 was initiated by MHRD to enable retrospective recognition to such courses.  The amendment was notified on 11<sup>th</sup> January 2019, after being passed by both Houses of Parliament. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>Notably this amendment only allows retrospective recognition up to Academic Session 2017-2018, thereby only regularizing the qualifications acquired by students in the past. It does not propose to leave it open for institutions to run unrecognized courses in future and thereafter approach for ex-post facto regularization.</strong></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">In all 23 institutions of the Central and State Govt have benefitted involving about <strong>13000</strong> students and around <strong>17000</strong> in-service teachers. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">As a result of these notifications the qualifications acquired by affected students and in-service teachers, now stands legally validated.</span></span></p>
