The new guidelines have been issued based on extensive consultations held with States and UTs. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">A strict lockdown was imposed throughout the country since March 24, 2020.  All activities were prohibited except essential activities. Subsequently, in a graded manner and keeping the overarching objective of containing the spread of COVID-19 in view, the lockdown measures have been relaxed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Salient features of the new guidelines</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Lockdown measures would continue to be implemented strictly in the containment zones. These will be demarcated by the State/ UT Governments, after taking into consideration the guidelines issued by the Health Ministry. Within the containment zones, strict perimeter control shall be maintained and only essential activities allowed. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">All activities that were prohibited earlier would be opened up in areas outside Containment Zones in a phased manner, with the stipulation of following Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), to be prescribed by the Health Ministry:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Phase I (permitted to open from June 8, 2020)</p>
