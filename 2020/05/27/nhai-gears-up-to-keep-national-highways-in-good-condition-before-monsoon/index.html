The aim is to facilitate timely action and keep the highway stretches traffic-worthy ahead of the monsoon season i.e. latest by 30th June, 2020.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">NHAI has issued new policy guidelines to help its ROs/PDs plan and prioritize better; and then expedite the process of highway maintenance in the desired manner. The target is to ensure thorough planning of the requisite activities and the implementation of the same in a time bound manner. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Regional Officers of NHAI have been delegated sufficient financial powers to take quick decisions regarding maintenance activities.  Project Directors have been advised to make assessment of the condition of highways supported by technology driven tools through car mounted camera/ drone/ Network Survey Vehicle (NSV) etc. for identification of various highway distress (like depression, rutting, cracking etc.) and plan rectification measures.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">All field officers have been directed to adhere to the timelines, regularly monitor the progress of maintenance work and keep reporting the same to the Authority at regular intervals. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">NHAI HQ will be monitoring the progress closely through its Project Management Software – Data Lake where pictures of before and after repair works would be uploaded, apart from other repair related information.</p>
