<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:black">Due to higher milk procurement and lower sales during the COVID-19 lockdown, the milk/dairy cooperatives have resorted to large scale conversion into high shelf-life products like milk powder, white butter, ghee, and UHT milk etc. Such conversion into high shelf-life products resulted in blockage of </span>funds<span style="color:black"> and </span>caused<span style="color:black"> difficulty in payment to the farmers. Due to decrease in demand for high valued products like ice-cream, flavoured milk, ghee, cheese etc., only a small quantity of milk are converted into value added </span>products<span style="color:black"> like Paneer and Dahi impacting the sales turnover and realization. This will result in limiting </span>the ability<span style="color:black"> of cooperatives to procure milk at the current level or they would be forced for downward revision of procurement price, which will affect the farmers.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:black">In order to meet the working Capital needs of the Cooperatives and Farmer owned milk producer companies,  Interest subvention will be given on working capital loan </span>taken from scheduled Commercial Banks/R.R.Bs/Cooperative Banks/Financial Institutions between 1<sup>st</sup> April 2020 and 31st March 2021 by Cooperatives/FPOs <span style="color:black">for conversion of milk into conserved commodities and other milk products.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:black">The scheme has made provisions for providing interest subvention of 2% per annum</span>, with an additional incentive of 2% per annum interest subvention to be given in case of prompt and timely repayment/interest servicing.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:black">This will help to ease out the working capital crisis for handling surplus milk and enable timely payment to the farmers. The scheme will be implemented by this Department through National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), Anand.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:black">The modified scheme envisages a budgetary provision of Rs 100 Crore earmarked for the component “</span>Interest Subvention on Working Capital Loans for Dairy sector” during 2020-21.<span style="color:black"> The scheme envisages to have the following benefits:</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:black">Due </span>to the onset of the situation<span style="color:black"> owing to Covid-19, a large number of small private dairies are reported to have closed </span>operations resulting<span style="color:black"> in diversion of milk to Cooperatives. These small private dairies were mainly catering to milk-based sweet making shops and local supplies in towns. Due to the restrictions imposed in view </span>of the Covid<span style="color:black">-19 epidemic, the supplies to hotels and restaurants by private as well as cooperatives have been affected. Due to problems faced such as shortage of Contractual labour, closure of distribution points, difficulties in getting packaging material etc. as well as supply challenges being faced by distributors, transporters, and  staff etc. most private dairies have either restricted their supplies or even closed down their shops . </span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:black">However the Cooperatives have continued with the procurement mostly at their earlier declared procurement rates and some cooperatives have even increased their procurement price. The price of Toned Milk (TM) and Full Cream Milk (FCM) by Cooperatives in January 2020 was Rs. 42.56/ litre and Rs. 53.80/litre and on 08.04.2020 was Rs. 43.50/litre and Rs. 54.93/litre respectively.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:black">The milk procurement by major cooperatives during March 2019 was 510 lakh litres per day (LLPD) and as on 14<sup>th</sup> April 2020 is approximately 560 LLPD, despite start of the lean season. I</span>n the last<span style="color:black"> one year there is an increase of 8%. Although procurement of milk varies seasonally and based on the domestic &amp; international demand, the sale of milk </span>at the domestic<span style="color:black"> market is more or less stable. Sale of milk by Cooperatives of India has dropped from 360 LLPD in February 2020 to 340 LLPD as on 14<sup>th</sup> April 2020.  Thus, while milk procurement increased by 8%, the sale reduced by 6 %. The total gap between procurement and sales is approximately 200 LLPD per day.  </span></span></span></p>
