The </span>aggregation <span style="color:black">is</span> f<span style="color:black">ound in abundance in what is called the substantia nigra portion in the </span>midbrain of patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">M<span style="color:black">any researchers from acrossthe world are </span>studying<span style="color:black"> the mechanism of how the proteinforms the aggregates, and how the aggregation results in the death of neuronal cells observed in </span>Parkinson’s disease<span style="color:black">. They believe that once these mysteries are uncovered, it could help develop a drug for the disease</span>, <span style="color:black">which is </span>badly needed and <span style="color:black">has been long overdue</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:black">Unfortunately, the aggregation of ASyn is not something th</span>at is <span style="color:black">easy to understand. The end point of the aggregation is the formation of small slender fibres or</span> `<span style="color:black">fibrils</span>’, in which the protein has a structure type, what is called a cross beta fold.<span style="color:black"> The fibrils are well studied thanks to a dye, Thioflavin T, which binds to the cross-beta structure and emits fluorescence. Scientists have solved </span>the <span style="color:black">three-dimensional structures of </span>the <span style="color:black">fibrils and have also learnt how to develop drugs to target them. </span>However<span style="color:black">, these drugs do not work in the clinical trials. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:black">These failures have made the scientists to think that perhaps they need to understand not only the fibrilsbut also the variety of intermediates that form early in the aggregation process. Unfortunately, the structure of these intermediates </span>could<span style="color:black"> not be </span>solved yet <span style="color:black">and hence it is difficult to target them using a drug delivery technique. Also, scientists have not been able to come up with a way by which a single technique could monitor both the early intermediate species and the fibrils, which form at the end. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px"><a name="_gjdgxs"></a><span style="color:black">Recently, scientists from IIT (ISM) Dhanbad and CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology,Kolkata, teamed up to find a solution to this issue. The leader of the IIT (ISM) team Dr. UmakantaTripathy, who is a physicist, studies nonlinear behaviour of biomaterials using Z-scan technique</span>, <span style="color:black">a machine </span>that<span style="color:black"> he himself </span>built <span style="color:black">at his home institute. Dr. Krishnananda Chattopadhyay of CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, on the other hand, is a biophysicist who has been working to understand ASyn aggregation and its implications in Parkinson’s disease. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px"><a name="_q7aosqcm6zkv"></a><span style="color:black">The team found that the Z-scan method is really a technique they have been looking for. It could help </span>in monitoring <span style="color:black">both the early and late stages of the aggregation of ASyn nicely. They found that the protein possesses nonlinearity starting from its monomeric state to the fibrillar structure</span>.<span style="color:black"> They made three particularly interesting observations: first, the strength of nonlinearity is relatively stronger in the case of fibrils when compared to other conformations of the protein, and second, each of the </span>d<span style="color:black">ifferent conformers populated in the differ</span>ent stages of the <span style="color:black">aggregation landscape seems to have a specific nonlinear </span>property that could be targeted.<span style="color:black">  The third and the most important result was a switch in the sign of nonlinearitywhen the late oligomers form at around 24 hours. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px"><a name="_y0enj8qrijmw"></a><span style="color:black">The team is excited about this observation because these late oligomers are supposed to be the most toxic species of ASyn and a method &#8211; which monitors these conveniently &#8211; can be really useful for both pharmaceutical and clinical research. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px"><a name="_p6wczi5cp24q"></a>Asked about the next action, Dr. Chattopadhyay said, “myself and my team at CSIR-IICB are exploring ways to <span style="background-color:white">use the Z-scan method to study ASyn aggregates <em>ex vivo</em> using a suitable animal </span>Parkinson’s disease<span style="background-color:white"> model, while </span><span style="color:black">Dr. Tripathy and his team planned to extend this method to other proteins and peptides to detect structures or conformations by systematic monitoring of their nonlinear values</span>”<span style="color:black">. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px">The study team included Sumanta Ghosh, Sakshi, Bikash Chandra Swain, and Ritobrita Chakraborty. They have submitted a research paper on their work to ACS Chemical Neuroscience. The journal has accepted to publish it. </span></p>
