<p class="has-text-align-justify">During the Covid-19 pandemic, there are individuals and families waiting for a single meal due to the loss of their livelihoods or no support system available. The government is doing its best to save these distressed families, but they cannot reach all. Hence, organizations<strong> </strong>like Vivekanand Seva Mandal (VSM) comes to the rescue of Orphans and Divyangs with the help of technology and networking.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">It was observed that along with the wage earners, many residential establishments are also in trouble because of this state of affairs. Many ashrams, orphanages as well as many settlements are facing food shortages and it is sometimes hard to reach them with government assistance. Hence, they welcomed a call from the volunteers of the RSS, that there is an orphanage and an ashram in the vicinity that is in need of necessary items.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">A total of <strong>129 children</strong> in  <strong>Nandadeep Foundation orphanage, Kolsevadi, Kalyan</strong> and the <strong>Jeevan Samvardhan Foundation Ashram School, Titwala</strong> were provided with food grains, vegetables, and some medical supplies. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In another incident, divyang families staying in Wadavali village near Dombivli received timely help from Vivekanand Seva Mandal (VSM) and RSS.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The sole bread earner of one of these families Mr. Dinesh Borse (name changed for privacy) lost his complete eyesight a few months ago, he had a proper vision till then but due to some infection has become blind now. Hence was unable to do his farming. From some source this family came to know about VSM and RSS&#8217; relief work and hence approached them.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">On receiving their call on the phone, usual questions like &#8211; what help you want, what are your requirements and so on were asked. In all the three families the bread earners were divyang or differently-abled. Two of them had lost their eyesight and one possessed only one leg.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">After verifying all these facts, a package was provided, which contained not only rice, pulses but also onion, potato, spices needed for regular cooking. It was a well-studied list of grocery that was made to serve the family fully. It is observed that charitable institutions more often give only a couple of items like grains or pulses, but Vivekananda Seva Mandal from Dombivali had given them from salt to potatoes everything that a family needs.</p>
