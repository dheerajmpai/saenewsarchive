<p class="has-text-align-justify">After India&#8217;s first nuclear test carried out on May 18, 1974, in Rajasthan&#8217;s Pokhran, no nuclear tests took place till 1998 when the then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and the scientific adviser to the Defence Minister Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam decided that it was time for the country to announce its nuclear status with a huge bang.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Atal Bihari Vajpayee was keen on going ahead with the nuclear test after he formed the government for the first time in 1996 but looking at the political turbulence, he called it off. Two years later, when he back to power he gave a green signal to the nuclear test and it was conducted successfully.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The brain behind the multiple nuclear tests carried at the Pokhran test range was of Kalam. After specializing in Aeronautical Engineering from Madras Institute of Technology, Kalam joined the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO). He was also the Scientific Adviser to Defence Minister and Secretary, Department of Defence Research &amp; Development from July 1992 to December 1999.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">During this period, the former president led the weaponization of strategic missile systems and the Pokhran-II nuclear tests in collaboration with the Department of Atomic Energy, which made India a nuclear weapon state.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Kalam, who had supervised the Pokhran-II explosions as the chief of the Defence Research and Development Organisation, camping in the Thar desert for over a fortnight, had said the testing was a &#8220;defining moment&#8221; in the country&#8217;s history, next only to adopt the path of economic liberalization in 1991.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">On May 11, 2015 the &#8216;Missile Man of India&#8217; had tweeted, &#8220;Today, I remember the hot day of 1998 at Pokhran: 53C. When most of the world was sleeping; India&#8217;s nuclear era emerged.&#8221;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Today as India celebrates the National Technology Day in the memory of that wonderful victory let’s have a look at what were “The Missile Man’s” visions for India.</p>



<p><strong>FREEDOM</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">He said “I believe that India got its first vision of this in 1857, when we started the war of Independence. It is this freedom that we must protect and nurture and build on. If we are not free, no one will respect us.” He added “In 3000 years of our history, people from all over the world have come and invaded us, captured our lands, conquered our minds. From Alexander onwards, The Greeks, the Turks, the Moguls, the Portuguese, the British, the French, the Dutch, all of them came and looted us, took over what was ours. Yet we have not done this to any other nation. We have not conquered anyone. We have not grabbed their land, their culture, their history and Tried to enforce our way of life on them. Why? Because we respect the freedom of others.”</p>



<p><strong>DEVELOPMENT</strong></p>



<p>“For fifty years we have been A developing nation. It is time we see ourselves as a developed nation. We are among the top 5 nations of the world in terms of GDP. We have a 10 percent growth rate in most areas. Our poverty levels are falling. Our achievements are being globally recognized today. Yet we lack the self-confidence to see ourselves as a developed nation, self-reliant and self-assured” he said. “Isn’t this incorrect?” he inquired.</p>



<p><strong>STAND UP TO THE WORLD</strong></p>



<p>“India must stand up to the world. Because I believe that, unless India stands up to the world, no one will respect us. Only strength respects strength. We must be strong not only as a military power but also as an economic power. Both must go hand-in-hand” he said while making a strong case for India to become a power to reckon with.</p>
