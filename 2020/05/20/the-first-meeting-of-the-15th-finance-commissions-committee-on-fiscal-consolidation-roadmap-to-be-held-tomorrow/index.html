N K Singh, Chairman, XVFC.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Action has already been taken by the Union Government on the Report of the XVFC for the year 2020-21.

Responding to the situation, the Union Government has given additional borrowing space of 2 percentage points of GDP to the State Governments, apart from the 3 per cent that was already available.</p>
