These are being regularly reviewed and monitored at the highest level.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India has been relatively able to decelerate the pace of COVID-19 and the impact can been seen in the data of COVID-19 cases. Compared to the global scale, where there are 62.3 cases per lakh, India still has only 7.9 cases/ lakh population. Similarly, for mortality per lakh population, while the global average rate is 4.2, India’s figure is pegged at 0.2. The relatively low death figures represent timely case identification and clinical management of the cases. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The focus on clinical management and recovery has resulted in the improvement in the recovery rate. More than 39.6 % of the confirmed cases have recovered bringing the total to 42,298 recoveries, as of today.  This is a reminder that the disease is curable and the clinical management protocols adopted by India are effective. It is observed in the recovery data that about 2.9% of all active cases under management require Oxygen support; about 3% of the active cases under management require ICU support and 0.45% of the active cases under management require ventilator support. India has concurrently been focusing on upgrading COVID dedicated health infrastructure.</p>
