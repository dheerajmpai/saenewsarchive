<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:black">The Health Minister said,“Among the specific target-oriented modified strategies that need to be put in place for combating malaria, dengue and chikungunya, our main focus should be on controlling the vector itself.” “Simple steps can be taken for keeping the surroundings clean and free from Aedes mosquitoes. Stagnant water should be checked and larva sites should be effectively neutralized. Success of the Vector Control Programme is related to community participation and ownership”, he said. He further added, “Commitment at all levels is essential for prevention and control of these diseases andit is the responsibility of all of us to ensure that we don’t create an environment for mosquitoes to breed.”</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:black">Dr. Harsh Vardhan further said that VBD problem is a perennial one and this year it has come at the time when the whole country is grappling with the outbreak of COVID-19. He further stated, “There was a severe outbreak of Dengue in Delhi in 2015, which affected nearly 16,000 people and killed 60. As compared to that situation, presently we are in a better position as around 50 dengue cases have reported so far in the city. However, we cannot afford to be complacent in our approach in our fight against Dengue.”</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:black">Dr. Harsh Vardhan said, “Community support is critical to stop the chain of vector transmission. There is a need to promote awareness among the community about the prevention and control of VBDs.” He stated, “It should be a collective effort and all three tiers of governance &#8211; Central Government and its agencies at national level, State Governments at state level and local bodies at grass root level &#8211; should converge in their efforts to mobilize the community for this public health activity.”</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:black">Commenting on the commendable role played by school children in previous years in creating awareness about VBDs and checking its spread, he said, “Earlier school-children played a very important role in creating awareness. But in the present scenario where all the education institutions, colleges and schools are closed due to COVID-19 outbreak, most of the school-children are at home.” Exhorting the people to come forward, he said, “During this lockdown 3.0, everyone should chip in to keep their surroundings clean and see that stagnant water is not accumulated in the trash or in used tyres, flower pots, vases, coolers, etc.” “All the citizens need to rise to the occasion and don the role of a super hero themselves and become ‘Swasthya Veer’ for combating the vector borne diseases themselves while fighting against the COVID-19”, he added.He further stated that the role of citizen has become really important in volunteering for checking the breeding sites herself/himself in her/his surroundings, especially in COVID-19 situation, where the breeding checkers are not allowed by the residents to enter the premises thereby affecting the whole process.</span></span></span></p>
