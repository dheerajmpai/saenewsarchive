Interacting with foreign missions in New Delhi, through Video Conference, he welcomed the interested countries who are planning to do business with India. The Minister said that India gives the most importance to ‘the fair dealing and the reciprocity’ while signing any multilateral agreements. This was the reason because of which India didn’t participate in Regional Economic Comprehensive Partnership(RECP). He advised that this is the best time to connect digitally for the planning of a road map for bilateral (or multilateral) agreements.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>The Minister appealed to other countries for the collaborative efforts against the outspread of Coronavirus pandemic. He said that India is ensuring the safety and well-being of the foreign nationals currently in India. He thanked them for participating in 9-minute light off, as asked by the PM on April 5.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Shri Goyal said that the recent surveys and studies have proved that ‘the tough and appropriate role played by the PM of India during the crisis’ is the best stimulus against the crisis and it has been appreciated in the country as well as all around the world. Mentioning about many world leaders including President Trump congratulating India for exporting medicines, Shri Goyal said that Indian Pharmaceuticals Industry is playing important role in producing and delivering medicines not only to India but also for the rest of the world. Expressing confidence that India will play a leadership role in the Post- COVID world, he said that India is ensuring that no country will remain deprived of the essential            medicines, especially underdeveloped countries. He assured them that if any assistance in the form of medicine is required from India, we will try to                fulfill it. But in the long term, we have to make a quick roadmap for the                 sustainable trade of the pharmacy sector. According to PM, as a global citizen,              it is our responsibility to serve the one in need.</span></span></p>
