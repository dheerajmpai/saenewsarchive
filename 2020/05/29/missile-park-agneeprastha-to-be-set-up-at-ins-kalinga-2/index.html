<p style="text-align:justify">        The Missile Park ‘AGNEEPRASTHA’ once completed will be dedicated to all the Officers, Sailors and Support Staff of INS Kalinga, who have served in this premier op-support Base of the ENC since its establishment in 1981. The Park also commemorates the award of the prestigious Unit Citation to INS Kalinga for the year 2018-19. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">        ‘AGNEEPRASTHA’ aims to capture glimpses of Missile History of INS Kalinga since 1981 till date.  The Missile Park has been set up with a replica of missiles and Ground Support Equipment (GSE) that showcase the evolution of missiles handled by the unit.  The exhibits have been created from scrap / obsolete inventory which have been reconditioned in-house. The main attraction is P-70 &#8216;Ametist&#8217;, an underwater launched anti-ship missile from the arsenal of the old &#8216;Chakra&#8217; (Charlie-1 submarine) which was in service with IN during 1988-91.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">      ‘AGNEEPRASTHA’ will also provide a one-stop arena for motivation and stimulation of inquisitive minds regarding the missiles and related technologies, from school children to Naval personnel and their families.  It is also intended to encourage a feeling of ownership and pride in the role of the Unit, and highlight the necessity of contribution of all personnel irrespective of rank/trade towards the overarching objective of ordnance availability, reliability and delivery on target, each and every time.</p>
