<p>With the commencement of the Kaleshwaram project, Telangana’s reservoirs are full of water and the farmers of Telangana have sown paddy in an area of 39 Lakh Acres, double than that of last year’s Rabi (17.5 Lakh Acres) season and even more than that of this year’s Kharif (31 Lakh Acres) season.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Irrespective of the huge opposition on the financial viability of the Kaleshwaram project, Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao commenced the project and is rushing to realize his dream of cropping 1 Crore Acres in a year.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">With the availability of water in addition to 24 hours free power supply, the farmers got a bumper harvest this season. The state government estimates a produce of 1,20,00,000 Metric Tonnes (MTs) of paddy this season. To support the hard work of the farmers, the government has announced that it will procure 75 Lakh MTs of paddy, the biggest ever procurement task by the State.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Although it is very happy to see that the efforts of the state government are bearing fruits, there is an underlying problem of storage and processing of this paddy. I.e., the combined storage capacity of all the rice mills and associated paddy godowns of the state is just over 1,12,00,000 MTs. In these storage facilities, there are already lakhs of tonnes of paddy stored during the last season waiting to be processed. Where will the government store the paddy that it plans to procure this season?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">While the government wants to lease the Convention centers, Function halls and other private places across the state to store paddy, what will happen once the lockdown is lifted and these private places of activities want to get back to normal? Even if it manages the storage problem, how will it process the entire paddy? Even if rice mills manage to process the entire paddy, what will the state do with all the Rice produced? The local consumption of rice throughout the year is not more than 50 Lakh MTs and the non-local supply from Telangana is around 35 Lakh MTs.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">So the pressing question is where will the government store the excess 90 Lakh MTs of paddy? How will it process the excess 90 Lakh MTs of paddy? What will happen to the excess 50 Lakh MTs of rice? This problem doesn’t seem to catch much attention amongst farmers, people, the political leaders, or even the mainstream media.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In order to attend to this, Telangana needs an additional rice milling capacity of 850 MTs per hour along with its associated storage. One way for the government to meet this additional capacity is to set up Mega Paddy food parks at multiple paddy hubs in the state. These Food Parks will be a one-point destination to all the industries associated with the paddy value chain. There is a huge scope for creating value out of paddy. Paddy drying units and paddy de-stoning units can be set up in these food parks so that the farmers can improve the quality of paddy before they sell and hence get a higher price for their produce.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Rice milling units can then process the high-quality paddy into Rice. Cutting down on drying and de-stoning costs will add to its profits. Rice bran, which is a byproduct of processing the paddy can be used to extract rice bran oil which has immense health benefits. Oil refineries can also be established to add further value.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Rice husk-based Biomass captive power plants can also be set up to meet the power requirements of these food parks using the rice husk produced from the Rice mills. Rice husk Ashcan further be used in the greener ways of manufacturing silica.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Further value can be added to rice by making fortified rice, which has a huge demand in all the public food distribution systems across the world that are tackling the malnutrition problem. Telangana can become a major exporter of fortified rice in the world.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Broken rice which is also a byproduct of paddy processing can be used to make products such as Rice Rava and Rice Flour. Grain-based alcohol distilleries can also be set up to produce different types of alcohols and spirits from the broken and rejected rice. In addition, these mega paddy food parks can have production units of other rice-based instant products like rice noodles, rice cakes, rice syrups, rice milk, and even rice paper. Countries in East Asia and Southeast Asia Have good demand for such instant products and Telangana can pave the way for other states of India to produce such products and export to these countries.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The integration of the paddy value chain is the only way to make paddy farmers, as well as the processing industries profitable. The State Government needs to invest in the basic common infrastructure for setting up these Mega Paddy Food Parks and incentivize the industry giants to invest in these Food Parks. Before all these, the Government should win the confidence of the existing Rice Millers, who will be the potential investors, by clearing all their pending bills. The required capacity of processing and its associated industries can attract investments to the tune of 10,000 Crores. In turn, providing direct employment to over 40,000 people and becoming a source of livelihood for lakhs of people.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In addition to all these, the Government should emphasize on pursuing the farmers to diversify their crop patterns and shift the focus away from paddy. If the government does not timely intervene on this issue, we would see lakhs of Tonnes of paddy being dumped in waste.</p>
