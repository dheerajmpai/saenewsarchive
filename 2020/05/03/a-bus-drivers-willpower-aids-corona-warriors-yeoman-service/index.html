<p class="has-text-align-justify">It is true that one&#8217;s optimism and willpower if strong is undefeatable. One&#8217;s optimism and strong willpower, can give courage to face any crisis.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"> Truck drivers who have been employed by many transporters are now interested in getting back to their homes, fearing that they will leave for their villages and their respective provinces as soon as they get the chance then in metropolitan cities like Mumbai, the transportation movement will be at a halt due to the lack of drivers. I had shared an opinion with some of my friends that if such a situation arises, we should think about it apriori and look at the available options. Among all of the reactions to that, two reactions seemed important. One opinion was that if such an event occurs drivers from Government buses and other services could be availed while another friend said Government buses too can be used for this purpose. There are options, But there are doubts about how useful they will be. A news item considering such an event was immediately read today. The news which appeared in the Hindustan Times newspaper regarding this matter had already increased some doubts.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Devidas Rathod, a 55-year-old resident of Manor near Palghar, works as a conductor in ST Corporation. This Government Bus acts as a carrier for daily up-down from Palghar to Mumbai. Currently, he is responsible for transporting 25 doctors from that area to KEM Hospital in Mumbai every day. He does so with a sense of duty and responsibility. Since his home is in a village about 21 km from Palghar, he arrives on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad highway every day to catch a truck and then the truck driver drops him off at Palghar. He reaches at the Palghar bus stand before time and then the bus carrying doctors leaves for Mumbai. This schedule was common for Devidas.  </p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">On Sunday, however, after waiting for a long time on the highway, he did not find even a single truck to reach Palghar. Not even a single truck was on the road. Rathod being worried thought that if I couldn&#8217;t reach on time, the 25 warriors who fought with Corona would not be able to reach the hospital on time, and without caring for what would happen next he started walking towards Palghar. Without waiting for the truck, Devidas started walking. The 55-year-old tired man reached Palghar after a 21 km long walk.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">When he rang the double bell of the bus traveling towards Mumbai, Devidas&#8217;s tired body could feel a sense of satisfaction in the mind. One&#8217;s reason should not be an obstacle in the duties of doctors and nurses who do up-down by the same ST bus every day to serve Corona patients. The &#8216;Service of Doctors and Nurses is of utmost importance today&#8217;, with such a noble thought, Rathod walked 21 km distance.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Realizing that he would have to walk to Palghar, Rathod rolled up his uniform and put it in his bag. The practice of walking, which has resulted from participating in many marathons, tuned out to be beneficial, thinking this Rathore had a sense of satisfaction. Before taking a walk that day, he took an extra bottle of glucose-containing water from his wife. He put on clothes to wear while walking, and started marching towards Palghar. Within minutes of reaching Palghar, he got dressed and got ready and the bus left for Mumbai. Rathod&#8217;s bus leaves Palghar at 6 am every day and leaves from Dadar towards Palghar again at 3 pm. After reaching Palghar in the evening, Rathod reaches his village 21 km away by catching another truck.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Rathod&#8217;s efforts deserve a great salute and on that particular day a single truck on road would&#8217;ve saved Rathore&#8217;s tiresome efforts.</p>
