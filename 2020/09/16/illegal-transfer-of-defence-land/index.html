<p style="text-align:justify">To prevent such incidences in future, the following steps are taken:-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The computerization of defence land records under the project ‘Raksha Bhoomi’ was undertaken by the Directorate General of Defence Estates in association with National Informatics Centre.  Defence Land Records contained in General Land Registers (GLRs) and Military land Registers (MLRs) were entered in the Raksha Bhoomi Software and made operational after verification and authentication of database in July, 2011.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Directorate General of Defence Estates (DGDE) has informed that 05 cases have come to notice, in the last three years (i.e. from 01.09.2017 to 31.08.2020).  Total area involved is 36.30 acres.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In two cases pertaining to Haryana (Narnaud Hisar, Distt. Hisar, area 29.99 acres) and one pertaining to Punjab (Muktsar, area 6.05 acres) the respective State Governments are claiming the defence land.  In all these cases the matter has been challenged by the DEO concerned and is presently subjudice in the court of the respective Divisional Commissioners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In the two cases of Union Territory of J&#038;K (Badamibagh Cantt., area 0.26 acres) the illegal transfer of defence land by private persons through sale deeds have been challenged by way of filing suit in the District Court by DEO concerned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Another instance has been noticed where an attempt was made to illegally transfer defence land (11.10 acres) in Bengaluru to Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation.  Based on the FIR lodged in the case, the said transfer has been stayed. </p>
