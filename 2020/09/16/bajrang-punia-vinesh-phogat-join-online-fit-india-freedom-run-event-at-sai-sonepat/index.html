<p style="text-align:justify">Bajrang Punia spoke on the importance of fitness in helping build a successful nation, “If you look at any successful country, it has a high number of fit people. I would encourage you to tell your family members and people in your society to remain fit. If you can keep yourself fit, then you can keep yourself away from illness. As an athlete, if we remain fit, stay healthy and eat properly, we can aspire to achieve our goals including the ultimate goal of winning an Olympic medal.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">VineshPhogat complimented the initiative of the Prime Minister and the Sports Minister, and moreover spoke of the responsibility sportspersons have towards society, “The Fit India Freedom Run is a very good initiative taken by the Sports Minister. As an athlete, I gain a lot by remaining fit but we will get encouraged if everyone around us remains fit too. During the coronavirus pandemic, those who were fitter were able to recover better from the disease. Our Prime Minister has done a lot for sports, the last 5-6 years have been very good for Indian sports and it is very important for us as sportspersons to set an example for society. I thank the PM and the Sports Minister for whatever they are doing for Indian sports.”</p>

You can sit and remain fit by doing yoga. If we remain fit, our country will grow.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Akhil Kumar, Arjuna awardee boxer said, “If you have strong fitness, you can return from injury better. I would encourage all my fellow athletes to maintain their fitness, look after their health and eat properly.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Women’s hockey player and Arjuna Awardee Deepika Thakur shared her perspective on fitness especially after motherhood, “I have a one-year old child, it is difficult but I do try to take one hour out in the morning before my baby wakes up to do my fitness exercises. If I can take time out after just having a baby, then others can too. It is important to maintain discipline in life.”</p>
