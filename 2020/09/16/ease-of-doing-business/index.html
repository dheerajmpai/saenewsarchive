The exercise involves identifying reforms which bring Ease of Doing Business (EoDB), in consultation with the States and UTs. Once identified, these reforms are compiled into an Action Plan and shared with States and UTs for its implementation in a time bound manner. Achievements made by the States and UTs are updated by them on the EODB portal(https://eodb.gov.in). Assessment of States and UTs on the basis of implementation of Action Plan is done by DPIIT. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">DPIIT has, so far, released four editions of its assessment under the State Reforms Action Plan. The first assessment was released on 14th September, 2015, followed by the second and third assessments on 31st October, 2016 and 10th July, 2018. The latest assessment was released on 5th September, 2020. In the fifth edition of the exercise, DPIIT has prepared a 301-point State Reforms Action Plan, 2020 and shared with States/UTs on 25th August, 2020. The Action Plan is spread across 24 reform areas with an addition of several sector-specific reforms to ensure sectoral coverage.</p>
