C. Sharma, Member(T&#038;RS) on 28.09.2020.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This system will be implemented shortly across all Zones of Indian Railways. Railwayâ€™s supply chain up to Stores Depots has already been digitized, however activities at user end are being done manually. Implementation of this system will bring in transformational changes from manual working to digital working with real time transactions and online information exchange among all stakeholders. This will ensure digitization of complete supply chain, including user depots.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The system will facilitate economy, efficiency and transparency besides improved asset management. It will ensure improved service level and satisfaction to customers.</p>
