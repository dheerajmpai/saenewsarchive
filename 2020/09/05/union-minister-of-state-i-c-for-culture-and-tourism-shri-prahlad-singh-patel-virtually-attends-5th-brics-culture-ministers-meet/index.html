<p style="text-align:justify">The Minister stated “Covid-19 has been a sad experience for us. But it has again showed us that nature does not discriminate among countries. It does not differentiate between people on the basis of caste and creed. Humans have divided the countries and defined borders by putting fences.  But culture is the bonding force above all manmade demarcations and connects people through love and harmony.  Therefore when we meet through such programs, we come back more enriched than before.”</p>
