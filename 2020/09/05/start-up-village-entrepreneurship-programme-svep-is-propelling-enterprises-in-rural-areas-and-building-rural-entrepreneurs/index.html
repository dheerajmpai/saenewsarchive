<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">SVEP addresses three major pillars of rural start-ups namely &#8211; finances, incubation and skill ecosystems. Activities under SVEP are strategically designed to promote rural enterprises, one of the key areas is to develop pool of community resource persons – enterprise promotion (CRP-EP) who are local and support entrepreneurs setting-up rural enterprises. Another key area is to promote the block resource center (BRC) in SVEP blocks, to monitor and manage the community resource persons, appraise SVEP loan application and acts as the repository of enterprise related information in the concern block. BRCs play the role to support sustainable revenue model to operate effectively and independently. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">During the initial years of implementation, the SVEP focused on mobilizing rural communities to setup and strengthen the institution structures, invest on training and capacity building on business management aspects for the BRC members, created pool of CRP-EPs and provided them intensive training, supported the entrepreneurs to scale up their existing enterprises as well as establish and support the new enterprises.  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Over the years the SVEP has made an impressive progress and has extended business support services and capital infusion to 153 blocks of 23 states as of August 2020.  Around, 2,000 trained cadre of Community Resource Person-Enterprise Promotion (CRP-EP) are providing services to rural entrepreneurs and as on August 2020, around 100,000 enterprises are supported by them.

<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">SVEP promotes both individual and group enterprises, set-up and promote enterprises majorly on manufacturing, trading and service sectors. The program invested largely on building the capacities of the entrepreneurs to run the businesses profitably based on the local demand and eco-system.

<p style="text-align:justify">Market plays an important role in SVEP: Haryana</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Local market/haat/bazaar operates once or twice a week, on weekends or monthly across the rural India, which serves as an important economic platform where a range of products, like agriculture produce, grains, vegetables, fruits, herbs, poultry produce, essential day-to-day commodities like groceries, fancy items, clothes, utensils, footwear, spices etc. is traded. A typical rural haat is mostly indigenous, flexible and multi layered structure which accommodates the economic activities of various nature. Apart from tapping various festivals, the state mission of Haryana established local haats in SVEP blocks of Pinjore and Gharaunda, to market products of the local entrepreneurs. The district and block units along with the local panchayat played an important role in coordinating with various departments to set up these markets. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Establishing these local markets has motivated SVEP entrepreneurs to take up demand based production, advertise their enterprise and increase earning opportunities. In both the blocks, these markets have been very effective in introducing new products like handicrafts, home-made pickles, masala powders, jute products and woolen products and so on. SVEP entrepreneurs from about 200 enterprises sold their products in 8 rural markets established in 2 block of Haryana, generating a revenue of Rs.6.31 lakhs. </p>
