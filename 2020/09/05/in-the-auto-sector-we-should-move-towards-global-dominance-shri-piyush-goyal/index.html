He said India is looking at its own domestic capabilities and expansion of its own economic and global engagement. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“India is willing to provide a very facilitated environment. We are engaged with many companies who are looking for more resilient value chains.

I am sure we will become trusted, reliable partners where countries across the world can look at greater engagement with India”, he said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Calling upon the automotive industry to work together in the spirit of partnership, he said “Ours is a listening Govt, and we are delighted to be available to the auto industry to find solutions &#038; work together in partnership to achieve a better future, increase localisation in India &#038; harness export potential on fair terms.

A focused approach in particular sectors will help us increase our contribution to global supply chains.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Goyal asked the automotive companies present in the country to ask their principles to reduce royalties. He said that reducing this could help the Indian units of these companies to sail through the crisis easily.

Here we have a large market and companies can get scale which is very important for cost competitiveness,” the minister added. </p>

He said that it is high time India starts looking at quality control and provides the world with high-quality products. “Once we get the quality consciousness in the country as a whole, we will transform India&#8217;s future, and that is the effort we are taking. Quality is never expensive. It brings down the cost. Quality brings in a culture in the company which always brings in: &#8211; More efficiency, Better productivity, and Makes cost reasonable. We need to bring in a culture of quality in the country, which has to be emulated by the customer. Only then will we become a global player”, he said.</p>
