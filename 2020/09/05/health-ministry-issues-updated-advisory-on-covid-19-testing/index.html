For two successive days more than 11.70 lakh tests have been conducted per day. A total of 4 crore and 77 lakh tests have been done so far across the country. There are now 1647 testing laboratories operational which cover all States/UTs. It is in this background that the Health Ministry has issued the updated Testing Advisory.  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">On recommendations of the National Task Force on COVID-19, the new Advisory has further simplified the testing process and given more freedom and flexibilities to the State authorities to facilitate enhanced ease of testing for the people. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">For the first time, along with more simplified modalities, the updated Guidelines provide for ‘On-demand’ testing in order to ensure higher levels of testing. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Advisory elaborates on the choice of tests (in order of priority) in various given settings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Choice of Test (in order of priority): </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">1. All symptomatic (ILI symptoms) cases including health care workers and frontline workers. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">2. All asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts (in family and workplace, elderly ≥ 65 years of age, immunocompromised, those with co-morbidities etc.) of a laboratory confirmed case to be tested once between day 5 and day 10 of coming into contact. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">3. All asymptomatic high-risk individuals (elderly ≥ 65 years of age, those with co-morbidities etc.) in containment zones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Choice of Test (in order of priority): </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">8. *All asymptomatic high-risk contacts(contacts in family and workplace, elderly ≥ 65 years of age, those with co-morbidities etc. [RAT is recommended as the first choice of test in order of priority]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">15. Patients presenting with atypical manifestations [stroke, encephalitis, hemoptysis, pulmonary embolism, acute coronary symptoms, Guillain Barre syndrome, Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome, progressive gastrointestinal symptoms, Kawasaki Disease (in pediatric age group)] based on the discretion of the treating physician.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">A totally new section has been added in the Advisory on “Testing on Demand” which for all practical purposes does away with prescription by a registered medical practitioner although State governments have the freedom to decide on simplified modalities. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The new section reads thus-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Tracking and contact tracing mechanisms should be ensured by the testing laboratories by notifying the public health authorities.</p>
