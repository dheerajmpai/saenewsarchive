Several strategic and calibrated measures have been taken for the prevention, containment and management of COVID-19. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It has been observed that after acute COVID-19 illness, recovered patients may continue to report wide variety of signs and symptoms including fatigue, body ache, cough, sore throat, difficulty in breathing, etc. The recovery period is likely to be longer for patients who suffered from more severe form of the disease and those with pre-existing illness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">A holistic approach is required for follow up care and well-being of all post- COVID recovering patients. Heeding to this, the Union Health Ministry has issued a Post COVID Management Protocol. This provides an integrated holistic approach for managing patients who have recovered enough from COVID for care at home. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Protocl is not meant to be used as a preventive / curative therapy.</p>
