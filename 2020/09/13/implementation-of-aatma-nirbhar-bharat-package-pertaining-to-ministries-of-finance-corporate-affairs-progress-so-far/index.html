He gave a clarion call for Aatma Nirbhar Bharat or a Self-Reliant India Movement. He also outlined five pillars of Aatma Nirbhar Bharat – Economy, Infrastructure, System, Vibrant Demography and Demand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Following the call of the Hon&#8217;ble Prime Minister, Minister for Finance &#038; Corporate Affairs Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman laid down the details of the Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Package in a string of press conferences from 13th May 2020 to 17th May 2020.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Ministries of Finance &#038; Corporate Affairs have immediately started implementing the announcements related to the economic package under Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan. The seriousness of the Government can be gauged from the regular reviews and monitoring of the implementation of economic package on an almost day to day basis.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Besides, NABARD has also launched Structured Finance &#038; Partial Guarantee scheme in collaboration with two agencies &#038; banks to help unrated NBFCs/MFIs to get credit from lenders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This mechanism worked out with two such agencies and banks will enhance eligibility of credit by 5-6 times to those small MFIs who do not have any rating.  Once all the earmarked Rs.500 crore for this scheme is deployed, credit availment by those small NBFCs/MFIs to an extent of Rs. 2500 to Rs. 3000 crore is envisaged. This will be a game changer in reaching out to the people especially women in  the  the remote &#038; unreached areas .</p>
