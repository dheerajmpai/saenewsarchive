<p style="text-align:justify">Talking about India’s mammoth potential, Shri Goyal said that the real unique selling point  of India should be around High Quality, Good Service and  Good Pricing. “India should get recognised the world over for its quality &#038; competitiveness. Quality will have to be integral for the planning of our future. We believe in Transparent pricing, Transparent trade, Free Market, No price controls, and No hidden subsidies”, he said</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Explaining the concept of AatmaNirbharBharat, Shri Goyal said that it is not about closing India&#8217;s doors to international trade &#038; engagement.“In fact, it is about opening it wider looking for greater engagement in global trade.

<p style="text-align:justify">On India being a huge and much-sought after market, the Minister said “It&#8217;s a market that businesses around the world want to engage with. The businesses will not only get a large Indian market but can also leverage this market to get economies of scale. Trading relations between 2 countries rest on the pedestal of high reciprocity &#038; equilibrium. More &#038; more countries are moving towards balanced trade. India also will have to engage with other countries to expand our trading relationships but on the strength of our own competitiveness.”  He said that if other countries want access to the market of 130 crore Indians then they will have to give us equal access to their market. India is not going to be a patient receiver of unfair trade practices.</p>

He assured that deal will entail substantive gains for the country. All the forthcoming trade deals will be undertaken after discussions with all the stakeholders, and the interests of dairy, agriculture, MSMEs and indigenous manufacturers will be properly safeguarded, he said. The Minister said that the trade with the US is increasing rapidly, and the withdrawal of GSP by the US has not made much impact. </p>
