For the first time, the Academy was conducting a &#8220;Combined&#8221; Foundation Course by including over 20 different Services from the government sector.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He said, in future, an attempt will be made to further enlarge the spectrum of Foundation Course by including other Services also. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This is in keeping with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision to come out of a state of silos and, instead, develop a common perspective and a common vision for all functionaries, across the services.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Addressing the 61st Foundation Day celebration of the Academy, Dr Jitendra Singh said, that the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration is one of the premier institutes not only in the Indian subcontinent, but in the entire world. He said that an era spanning six decades is a significant time in the history of an Institution and the way Academy has evolved over the years bears ample testimony to the sweat, toil and vision of those who have nurtured it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Extending his felicitations to the entire fraternity of the Academy under the leadership of Dr Sanjeev Chopra, an erudite scholar and administrator, he congratulated the Academy for delivering out of box solutions much ahead of deadlines, for designing all-inclusive training and pedagogical techniques, for embracing state of the art Technology, for making a social and ecological impact while leaving behind a set of best practices in every domain. He expressed satisfaction that the Academy is continuously training the Pioneers to fight the future challenges.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s penchant for Governance Reforms, Dr Jitendra Singh recalled the address by PM to Civil Servants last year at Kevadia in Gujarat, where he said, “Every effort made with impartial and selfless spirit is the strong foundation of New India. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">To fulfil the dream of a New India, 21st century thinking and dreams are indispensable in our bureaucracy &#8211; a bureaucracy that is creative and constructive, imaginative and innovative, proactive and polite, professional and progressive, energetic and enabling, efficient and effective, transparent and tech-enabled”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Minister also referred to Prime Minister’s two-day visit to LBSNAA in 2017, where he had extensively interacted with Officer Trainees of 92nd Foundation Course and gave them the mantra of coming out of silos and focussing on the theme of constant learning. He said, to fulfil this novel thought, the Union Cabinet recently passed Mission Karmayogi-a National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB), which he said will go a long way in creating a new future ready civil service for a New India. He said, it is an endeavour to incarnate civil services into a real Karmayogi who is Creative, Constructive, Proactive and Technically Empowered to face the future challenges. The Union Cabinet also passed NRA recently for ease of aspiring candidates, but Mission Karmayogi harps on constant learning after one has joined the services, he added.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Similarly, he said that DoPT in April this year launched a learning platform (https://igot.gov.in) with an exclusive window for Corona warriors and within 10-15 days of its launch, more than 25 officers registered and got trained on the platform. Referring to another initiative of monitoring 700 Districts for Corona Management, Dr Jitendra Singh said that young collectors have played a stellar role in this with on-spot decision making. He pointed out that one of the reasons for this high-quality performance was that IAS officers who had served as Assistant Secretaries in Government of India had gained from their mentorship in Union Government, again a first and out of box idea of Modi Government.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dr. Jitendra Singh said that over the last few months, India has shown to the world that despite the crippling Corona crisis, the show goes on as smoothly as during the pre-pandemic times. He added that it is extremely heartening to learn that the Academy is now preparing for the first and the largest Combined Foundation Course in these times of Corona and assured full support for its success. He also expressed happiness about the Academy&#8217;s initiative to spread the message of our ancient heritage of Ayurveda, Yoga and associated culture of living in harmony with Nature. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dr. Jitendra Singh released a Publication- a compilation of articles on lesser known Heroes of Freedom Movement on the occasion. At the end of the programme, employees of the Academy were felicitated for their exemplary work. </p>
