Indian Railways has also initiated colony redevelopment programme wherein funds generated from commercial exploitation of unutilized FAR (Floor Area Ratio) shall be used to redevelop old colonies at no cost to Railways. RLDA has been entrusted with 85 land parcels covering an area of 254.33 Hectare for commercial development and 84 colonies in various Zonal Railways for redevelopment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Further, Station redevelopment is planned by leveraging real estate potential of sparable land and air space in and around the Stations, inviting private participation. It is Railwayâ€™s endeavour to generally develop Stations at no cost to Railways. For this, Railway conducts techno-economic feasibility studies of Stations across the country. Based on the outcome of these feasibility studies, Stations are taken up for redevelopment in phases.</p>
