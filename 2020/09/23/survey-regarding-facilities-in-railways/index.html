<p style="text-align:justify">One lakh calls were made every day to reserved passengers randomly for obtaining their feedback. The feedback has been discontinued since the Covid outbreak as very limited number of trains have been plying over Indian Railways. However, no survey is being conducted based on the socio-economic profile of passengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">To cater to the travelling needs of lower income groups, Indian Railways operate Mail Express trains having General Class coaches &#038; Sleeper Class coaches. Besides, fully unreserved services like Jan Sadharan, Janseva, Jan Nayak Express, Antyodaya Express, some Intercity trains, passenger trains are also operated by Indian Railways. Further, trains are also augmented with General Class and Sleeper Class coaches as per commercial viability and operational feasibility. Accordingly, during the years 2019-20, of the total 1490 coaches utilized for augmentation of existing services, 940 Coaches (524 Sleeper Class, 389 General Class &#038; 27 Second Class chair car coaches) were to facilitate the passengers of lower income groups. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Augmentation of services and coaches are an ongoing activity based on various parameters including demand, commercial and operational viability.</p>
