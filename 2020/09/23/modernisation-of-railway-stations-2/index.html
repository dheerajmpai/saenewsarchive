Contracts have been awarded for redevelopment of Anand Vihar (Northern Railway), Bijwasan (Northern Railway) and Chandigarh (Northern Railway) railway stations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Station redevelopment is planned by leveraging real estate potential of sparable land and air space in and around the stations, through private participation. The selection of developer is done following a transparent and competitive bidding process.  Recently, Request for Qualification (RFQ) was invited for redevelopment of eight (8) railway stations viz. Nagpur, Gwalior, Amritsar, Sabarmati, Nellore, Puducherry, Dehradun &#038; Tirupati on Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode.  Private developers have shown interest and accordingly, RFQ applications for all 8 stations have been received.</p>
