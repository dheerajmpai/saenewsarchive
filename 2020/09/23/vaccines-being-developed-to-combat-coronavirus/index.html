<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), an autonomous organisation under the Department of Health Research, has informed that it is facilitating the following studies related to COVID-19 vaccines:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">(i) An inactivated whole virion candidate vaccine (BBV152) for SARS-CoV-2 has been developed by Bharat Biotech International Ltd (BBIL) using the virus isolate (NIV-2020-770) provided by ICMR-National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. Characterization of the vaccine candidate has been undertaken at ICMR-NIV followed by safety and tolerability studies in small animals like rats, mice and rabbits. Status of clinical trials is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">(ii) A DNA vaccine (ZyCov-D) has been developed by Cadila Healthcare Ltd. Pre- clincial toxicity studies were conducted in small animals: mice, rats, rabbits and guinea pigs. The vaccine has been found to be safe and immunogenic. Cadila has partnered with ICMR for conduct of parallel pre-clinical studies in rhesus macaques. Status of clinical trials is as follows:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">(iii) Serum Institute of India (SII) and ICMR have partnered for clinical development of two global vaccine candidates:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">ICMR and SII have also partnered for clinical development of a glycoprotein subunit nanoparticle adjuvanted vaccine developed by Novavax from USA. The trial will be initiated in second half of October after the vaccine is manufactured by SII. The trial is led by ICMR-National AIDS Research Institute (NARI), Pune.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As per details provided by Department of Biotechnology (DBT)/Department of Science and Technology (DST), more than 30 vaccine candidates have been supported which are in different stages of development. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">CDSCO has informed that it has granted permission to conduct clinical trials in various clinical trial sites such as New Delhi, Chennai, Chandigarh, Jaipur, Kanpur, Surat, Hyderabad, Pune, Mumbai, Ahmadabad, Bhubaneswar, Patna, Gorakhpur etc. and the trials are  on going. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Presently, under Universal Immunization Program (UIP) vaccine distribution is based on Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network (eVIN) system. eVIN is an internet based digital system to track routine immunization, vaccine stocks, storage temperature in about 25,000 dedicated cold chain storage points across the country as well as movement of vaccine. The vaccine is distributed to health facilities and outreach station sites, so as to reach in all areas. even system is regularly monitored by health authorities at state and district level. eVIN system is being enhanced to address the needs for distribution and tracking of COVID 19 vaccine, when it becomes available. </p>
