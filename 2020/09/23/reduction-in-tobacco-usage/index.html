Some of the major steps are as under;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As part of the Global Tobacco Surveillance System (GTSS), three rounds of Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) among 13-15 year-old school going children in 2003, 2006 and 2009 and two rounds of Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) among 15 years and above in 2009-10 and 2016-17 have been undertaken.  These surveys are global standards for systematically monitoring adult and youth tobacco use (smoking and smokeless) and track the key tobacco control indictors. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The National Monitoring framework for Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases (NCD), stipulates relative reduction in prevalence of current tobacco use by 15% and 30% by 2020 and 2025 respectively, to the baseline levels of 2010. The National Health Policy (NHP), 2017 also reiterates the relative reduction of 15% in tobacco use by 2020 and of 30 percent by 2025, which is in line with the above Targets and Indicators under the NCD Frame Work.</p>
