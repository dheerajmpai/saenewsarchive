<p style="text-align:justify">For the development of National Land Bank, Government intends to solicit the details of industrial land with plot level information, connectivity thereto, basic facilities, other facilities available and contact details of authorities/developer of the park.    </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Government agencies are provided with unique User ID and password to upload the land details. However, the other investors can go to https://iis.ncog.gov.in/parks and simply register on the portal by creating a username and password and login to see the information available on the portal.</p>
