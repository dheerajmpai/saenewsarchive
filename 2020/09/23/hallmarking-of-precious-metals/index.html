The online system enables the jewellers to submit the application for registration and fees online. In this system there will be no human interface in processing the applications. The moment a jeweller submits the application with the requisite fees, he will be granted registration. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">For Assaying and Hallmarking Centres, the online system will ensure that applications to start a new centre or renew the existing license can be submitted online. Entire process of recognition, which involves audit of the centres, submission of audit report, and grant of recognition or renewal, has been automated. The applicant will have all the information available with him and can monitor the processing of applications.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">As mentioned at (a) &#038; (b) above, digital solutions for registration and renewal process for licenses for jewellers and for recognition and renewal of Assaying and Hallmarking (A&#038;H) Centres have been made for providing ease of doing business.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">For setting up of Gold Assaying and Hallmarking Centre in any district in India, where no A&#038;H Centre exists, the Government provides financial assistance to the tune of 30 to 75% of the total cost of machinery and equipment, depending on the location and ownership. </p>
