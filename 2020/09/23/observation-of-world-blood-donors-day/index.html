The theme of World Blood Donor Day 2020 was “Safe Blood Saves Lives”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC) issued communications to all State Blood Transfusion Councils (SBTCs) for observance of WBDD 2020 through conduction of blood donation camps and awareness generation activities for promoting the cause of Voluntary Blood Donation (VBD) through a multi-media approach and in partnership with all stakeholders; while maintaining compliance to the social distancing and other norms as per the COVID-19 advisories issued from time to time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">There has been no reported instance of shortage of blood in various blood banks causing lot of difficulties to patients. Though the collection of blood has reduced during this year as compared to the previous years, there has also been an equivalent reduction in demand for blood due to deferred elective surgeries and non-urgent clinical conditions needing blood transfusion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Communications were issued to all State Health Ministers from Hon’ble Minister for Health and Family Welfare requesting for their interventions for augmenting VBD. A National level committee set up by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare periodically reviewed the status of availability and adequacy of blood supplies across different States/ Union Territories. Special provisions were made with the support of Ministry of Home Affairs to facilitate the unhindered movement of blood donors, blood mobile and blood transportation vans. Blood Donor Appointment Letters and permission letters were issued for facilitating the movement of blood donors and mobile teams for blood collection. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Registration of patients of thalassemia and sickle cell disease was enabled on eRaktkosh portal to raise their requirement and connect to blood centres as per availability. Blood centres were encouraged to utilize the provisions under extant regulations for transfer of tested blood and blood components between licensed blood centers and to blood storage centers so as to ensure timely supply of blood to needy patients. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Steps have been taken to engage with different Government Departments, voluntary organizations like Indian Red Cross Society, blood donor associations, professional associations and other stakeholders for creating opportunities to donate and raise public awareness on the need for safe blood donation in the country. The Government supports various activities like conducting blood donation camps, observance of events on VBD days and motivating youth groups in coordination with agencies like Nehru Yuva Kendra Sansthan, National Service Scheme, Red Ribbon Clubs in various Universities and Colleges, etc. The Government has also made a provision of two special casual leaves per year that can be availed by Central Government employees for donating blood. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The policy of the Government is to have at least one blood centre in each district and blood centre facilities are available across all except 63 districts in the country.  However, even in these districts, need for blood and blood components are met through the blood centres in neighbouring districts.</p>
