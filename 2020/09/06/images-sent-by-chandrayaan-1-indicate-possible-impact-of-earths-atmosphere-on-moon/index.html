<p style="text-align:justify">Scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) say that this could be because the Earth&#8217;s own atmosphere is lending a helping hand which, in other words, means that the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere could be protecting the Moon as well.  Thus, the Chandrayaan-1 Moon data indicates that the Moon&#8217;s poles are home to water, this is what the scientists are trying to decipher. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dr Jitendra Singh said, as for Chandrayaan-3 is concerned, the launch may now take place somewhere in early 2021.  Chandrayaan-3 will be a mission repeat of Chandrayaan-2 and will include a Lander and Rover similar to that of Chandrayaan-2, but will not have an orbiter. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Meanwhile, preparations are going on for India’s first ever Human Space Mission Gaganyaan, said Dr Jitendra Singh.  The training processes and other procedures are also in place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Constraints due to Covid pandemic led to some disruptions in the plan for Gaganyaan but efforts are going on to stick to the timeline of around 2022, he said. </p>
