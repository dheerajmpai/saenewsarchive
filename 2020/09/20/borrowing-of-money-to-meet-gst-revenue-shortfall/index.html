Attorney General of India, wherein States were given two options to meet their GST compensation shortfall for current FY from market borrowing. This was stated by Shri Anurag Singh Thakur, Union Minister of State for Finance &#038; Corporate Affairs in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">      However, some States/UTs have suggested Central Government to borrow money from market and compensate States to meet GST revenue shortfall. In this regard, it is submitted that Central Government continues to remain engaged with the States who have not given either of the options, the Minister stated. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">      Shri Thakur said that the details of the two borrowings options were communicated to the States by the Department of Expenditure as under: &#8211; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Option 1 </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Option 2 </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">a. Each state’s borrowing limits for the year will be based on the following calculation: Basic eligibility (3 % of GSDP) + Amount allowed for shortfall as per Item I above of Option 2+ up to 1% of GSDP (reform-linked as per paras 5 to 8 of DOE OM) </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">                                                          or </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Basic eligibility (3% of GSDP) + 1% of GSDP + up to 1% of GSDP (reformlinked as per paras 5 to 8 of DOE OM) whichever is higher. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">b. The additional unconditional borrowing limit of 0.5% and the final (bonus) tranche of 0.5% under para 4 of the DOE OM will not be separately available, being subsumed under the calculation above. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">c. States will remain eligible for the reform-linked tranches of borrowing under paras 5 to 8 of the DOE OM this year but shall not be eligible to carry them forward. The maximum amount which can be availed under that OM shall stand reduced to 1% of GSDP instead of 2% of GSDP. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Minister also stated that it was also decided that States will give their preference and views thereon. Thereafter on finalisation of scheme, the states can choose either Option 1 or Option 2 and accordingly their compensation, borrowing, repayment etc will be dealt as per their individual choice. Abstract of the opinion of the Ld. Attorney General is as per Annexure.</p>
