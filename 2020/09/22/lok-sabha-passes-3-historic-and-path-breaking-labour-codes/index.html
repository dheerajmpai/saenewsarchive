<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Gangwar said that under the dynamic leadership of visionary Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, this Government has taken number of steps to fulfill the dreams of Baba Saheb Ambedkar from 2014 onwards and gave equal importance to ‘Shramev Jayate’ and ‘Satyamev Jayate’.   Government is ceased with the problems faced by workers and for the last 6 years, My Ministry has been working tirelessly to provide social security and other welfare measures to both organised and unorganised workers including during this Covid-19 epidemic.

Out of the 4 labour codes, Code on Wages has already been passed by Parliament and have become the law of the land.  All the labour laws (29 in number) being amalgamated into 4 labour codes are :</p>
