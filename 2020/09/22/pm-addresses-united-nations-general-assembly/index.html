He added being a founding signatory of the UN Charter, India was part of that noble vision which reflected India’s own philosophy of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ &#8211; which sees all creation as a family.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Paying tributes to those who advanced the cause of peace and development including the UN peacekeeping Missions, the Prime Minister said our world today is a better place because of the United Nations. About the UN declaration adopted today, the Prime Minister said while much has been achieved, the original Mission remains unfulfilled. And the far-reaching declaration that we are adopting today acknowledges that work still needs to be done: in preventing conflict, in ensuring development, in addressing climate change, in reducing inequalities, and in leveraging digital technologies. The declaration also acknowledges the need for reform of the United Nations itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Prime Minister said without comprehensive reforms, the UN faces a crisis of confidence and today’s challenges cannot be fought with outdated structures. He added that for today’s interconnected world, we need a reformed multilateralism: that reflects today’s realities; gives voice to all stakeholders; addresses contemporary challenges; and focuses on human welfare. India looks forward to working with all other nations towards this end.</p>
