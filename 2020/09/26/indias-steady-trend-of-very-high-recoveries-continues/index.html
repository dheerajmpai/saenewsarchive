<p style="text-align:justify">India has recorded 93,420 new recoveries in the last 24 hours. With this, the total number of recoveries are 48,49,584.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">With the increase in daily recoveries, the Recovery Rate has also sustained its upward trend. It currently is positioned at 82.14% today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India has maintained its top global ranking in total recoveries with such high successive single day record numbers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As India records more recoveries than the new cases, the gap between Recovered Cases and the Active Cases is continuously widening. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Recoveries are more than 5 times Active Cases. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The recovered cases (48,49,584) exceed the active cases (9,60,969) by nearly 39 lakh (38,88,615). </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This has also ensured that the active caseload accounts for merely 16.28% of the total positive cases. This has sustained on its steady declining path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Following the national lead, 24 States/UTs are also reporting higher number of new recoveries than the new cases.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">10 States/UTs account for nearly 73% of the New Recovered cases.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Maharashtra has maintained this lead with 19,592 new recoveries.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">These sustained encouraging results have been made possible with the Centre-led proactive and calibrated strategy of TEST TRACK TREAT with a sharp focus on ‘Chase the Virus” approach. States/UTs have effectively identified positive cases at an early stage through high &#038; aggressive levels of countrywide testing. This has been supplemented with prompt surveillance &#038; tracking to identify the contacts to curb spread of the infection. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Centre has issued Standard of Care protocol to ensure uniform and high quality medical care for those in home/facility isolation and hospitals. These have been upgraded periodically drawing from the emerging global and national evidences. The Union Government is supporting the efforts of the States/UTs through technical, financial, material and other resources.</p>
