<p>&#8216;Political Hindu-ness’ or Hindutva is one of the most contested ideologies in the political history of independent India. With the founding fathers of the newly formed republic trying to juxtapose every element of Indianess with the western framework, the forces of Hindutva couldn’t establish itself as a force to reckon with. Decades of the Congress rule transformed the idea of secularism enshrined in our Constitution to blatant minority appeasement and their vote bank politics. Post the victory of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2014 and the coronation of Narendra Modi as the prime Minister of India, Hindutva has come to occupy the centre stage of Indian politics. The interesting fact to observe here is that it’s not just the BJP but the arch-rivals of Hindutva appropriating variants of the same ideology.</p>



<p>In the first general elections of 1951-52, Hindu Mahasabha, Bharatiya Jana Sangh and the Ram Rajya Parishad could win only 3 seats each which the Congress party won the elections with 364 seats. The Communist Party of India had won 16 seats, becoming the second-largest party after the Congress. After few successive elections, both Hindu Mahasabha and Ram Rajya Parishad faded away from India’s political landscape while Bharatiya Jana Sangh continued to improve its tally. After the collapse of the Janata Party government in 1980 and the formation of BJP, the party could win only 2 seats in the Lok Sabha election of 1984 when the Congress swept the mandate with a tally of 404 seats. Following Rajiv Gandhi’s misadventure in Shah Bano case and the banning of Salman Rushdie’s novel, the Satanic verses there were dissents in the Hindu community which swelled after the beginning of Ram Janmabhumi agitation lead by senior BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani. BJP won 89 seats in 1989 and the tally went to 113 in 1991 elections. BJP’s numbers in Lok Sabha increased with the rising Hindu consciousness and BJP formed its first 13-day government in 1996 under the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Again BJP and its allies formed the government in 1998, but later it collapsed too. In 1999 National Democratic Alliance (NDA) came to power with Vajpayee as its political head. He became the first non-Congress PM to complete his full term. In 2004, the Congress again came to power and reigned till 2014. But the scenario changed after the 2014 election.</p>



<p>Modi’s landmark victory caught India’s ‘commuo-liberals’ by surprise. He was vilified by these intellectuals for 12 years post the Gujarat riots in 2002. People who couldn’t even accept Modi’s accession to power as Indian PM in 2014 started malicious ploys to defame him, his government and the nation itself. The award-wapsi-drama went on till Bihar Legislative Assembly elections in 2015 where the BJP was defeated by the JDU-RJD-Congress combine. Later this Mahagadhbandhan Alliance fell and JDU formed the government with BJP. Massive propagandas against the BJP governments both at the central and state levels ranged from EVM manipulation to cow vigilantism. The target was Modi, who symbolised Hindutva in its 21st-century form.</p>



<p>BJP’s election manifesto throughout these years mentioned removal of article 370, construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya and bringing in the Uniform Civil Code. In its first term (2014-2019), BJP waited for laying the ground for realising its poll promises even when the party had a majority in the Parliament. In the very beginning of its second term, on August 5, 2019 article 370 which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir was abrogated. Political pundits had predicted retaliatory action from militants, but in reality, terrorism has reduced substantially in the Kashmir valley. On the same day in 2020, the groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of Ram Mandir at Ram Janmabhumi in Ayodhya was done. Interestingly certain posters from the Congress domain claimed that Congress was responsible for the construction of Ram Mandir. The former CM of Madhya Pradesh and senior Congress leader&nbsp;<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/mp-congress-will-send-11-silver-bricks-for-for-construction-of-ram-temple-kamal-nath/articleshow/77350493.cms&quot; \t &quot;_blank">Kamal Nath</a>&nbsp;had claimed that the state unit of the Congress party would send 11 silver bricks for the construction of Ram Mandir. Congress General Secretary Priyanka Vadra had hoped that the groundbreaking ceremony would become a symbol of “<a href="https://theprint.in/politics/in-supporting-ram-mandir-congress-is-bowing-low-for-temporary-success-says-kerala-mp/476203/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">national unity</a>”. No parties other than the Muslim League, AIMIM and the left parties opposed the construction of Ram Mandir.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Left parties consume a greater amount of time to understand the ground reality. They had taken multiple initiatives to take women to the Sabarimala Temple in Kerala even when the move was widely condemned by the Hindu devotees. In the Lok Sabha elections of 2019, the left parties won only one seat in Kerala while the United Democratic Front led by the Congress went on to win 19 seats. Post the verdict, CPIM hasn’t tried to interfere with the Sabarimala issue hence leaning the electoral potential of the Hindu wrath. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has also been rebranding himself as a Janeudhari (Sacred thread wearing) Brahmin. Just before various state elections, he was seen doing temple tours to woo Hindu votes. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal was also seen reciting Hanuman Chalisa just before the Delhi elections. Recently, a piece of news emerged from West Bengal that CM Mamta Banerjee led government was about to provide Rs 1000 as incentives to the Brahmin priests.</p>



<p>Contrary to his competitors, PM Modi had never used his Hindu identity according to his convenience. Routinely he offers payers at the temples, does aarti near the shores of Ganga and many times he was seen wrapped in Saffron- the sacred colour of the Hindus. Modi’s mass appeal among the Hindus population has made the opposition parties think of their appeasement politics towards certain sections who could be their reliable vote banks. Evaluating the approach of India’s ruling dispensation and the opposition parties, it can be stated that Hindutva has emerged as the new normal in Indian politics.</p>
