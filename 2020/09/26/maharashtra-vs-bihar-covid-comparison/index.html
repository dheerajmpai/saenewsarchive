<p>Maharashtra and Bihar are states with the same population (like for like comparison) and it is worthy that we discuss why one state has failed and other succeeded in fighting covid.</p>



<p>If we want to look at covid data, the WHO standard of Test Positivity Rate (TPR) of 5% is very important. At present the TPR of Maharashtra is 20.7% and continuously increasing while that of Bihar is 2.8% and is second lowest in India. It is important to note that both the states have performed almost the same number of tests. Maharashtra has been leading the Covid count from the beginning and is far ahead of other states. In fact, the number of cases is even more than Russia. And despite this, the state has not ramped up its testing significantly. Compare this to Bihar, it has poor health infrastructure but around August when the case load increased along with TPR it enhanced its testing significantly. It is continuously conducting more than 1 lakh tests daily since 10 August and off late has increased it to more than 1.5 lakh test per day. This has led to TPR falling from 8% to 2.8%.</p>



<p>Other area of concern is the number of deaths, both states have same population but 33886 people have died in Maharashtra compared to 874 in Bihar. The case fatality ratio (death/case) is 2.7% for Maharashtra while its 0.5% for Bihar. The Case Fatality Ratio in Maharashtra is second highest in country.</p>



<p>While one may argue, that Maharashtra being an urban centre has been affected more, it is a fact that New York, which is also an urban centre, in US has successfully controlled the Virus. Every state has its own challenge, Bihar has very high population density and it had to ensure that incoming migrant labourers do not become the carriers of covid. In Bihar, the virus has been restricted to Patna but in Maharashtra it has spread to most of the districts.</p>



<p>Another similarity between Bihar and Maharashtra is both have a coalition government. While Nitish Kumar is an experienced administrator, Uddhav Thackeray has had to face the pandemic within 3 months of swearing-in. The state none-the-less had to suffer due to this inexperience. Moreover, amidst all this it unnecessarily gave attention to the matters of Bollywood.</p>



<p>Testing early has been the mantra to control this covid, and Maharashtra can learn from Bihar and should ramp up its testing enormously to bring the TPR below 5%. Increasing in testing leads to more cases early on, but states like Bihar, Gujarat and Delhi has shown that how ramping up of testing can control Covid.</p>
