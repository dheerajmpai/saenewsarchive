Ltd, Krishnagar, West Bengal,  stated that  “The technology of Automatic Biomass  is a very useful solution towards the problem of stubble burning especially in Punjab, Haryana, UP and Delhi. The machine is simple in operation, low cost and can be operated by a single operator. Apart from straw, other biomass like leaves, saw dust, grass can be converted into briquette. Also, this is in line with the dream of our  Prime Minister for making a ‘Swachh Bharat’.
