While acknowledging the contribution, DrJitendra  Singh said, Prime Minister NarendraModi enjoys a very high degree of faith, trust and credibility among the people and that is why whenever he gives a call for any cause, it spontaneously transforms into a mass movement. We saw this when he gave a call for Swachh Bharat Mission and building of toilets or for surrendering the gas subsidy or observing early lockdown and other guidelines in view of COVID pandemic. Dr Jitendra Singh lauded the Prime Minister’s vision and foresight which inspired the setting up of an exclusive fund under the name “PM CARES Fund”. Within a short span of time, he said, the response has been so overwhelming that on the one hand, philanthropists and big Business Houses come forward to make contributions, on the other hand small children have contributed whatever savings they had from their pocket money. </p>
