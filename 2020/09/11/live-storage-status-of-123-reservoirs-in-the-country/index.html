Out of these reservoirs, 43 reservoirs have hydropower benefit with installed capacity of more than 60 MW. The total live storage capacity of these 123 reservoirs is 171.091 BCM which is about 66.36% of the live storage capacityof 257.812 BCM which is estimated to have been created in the country. As per reservoir live storage available in these reservoirs is 142.234 BCM, which is 83% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. However, last year the live storage available in these reservoirs for the corresponding period was 139.647 BCM and the average of last 10 years live storage was 120.667 BCM. Thus, the live storage available in 123 reservoirs is102% of the live storage of corresponding period of last year and 118% of storage on average of last ten years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The northern region includes States of Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan. There are 8 reservoirs under CWC monitoring having total live storage capacity of 19.17 BCM. As per the total live storage available in these reservoirs is 15.04 BCM which is 78% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. The storage during the corresponding period of last year was 91% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 83% of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. Thus, storage during current year is less than the corresponding period of last year and is also less than the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Eastern region includes States of Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal, Tripura and Nagaland. There are 18 reservoirs under CWC monitoring having total live storage capacity of 19.43 BCM. As per the total live storage available in these reservoirs is 14.34 BCM which is 74% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. The storage during corresponding period of last year was 75% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 65% of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. Thus, storage during current year is less than the corresponding period of last year and is better than the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Western region includes States of Gujarat and Maharashtra. There are 42 reservoirs under CWC monitoring having total live storage capacity of 35.24 BCM. As per the total live storage available in these reservoirs is 31.95 BCM which is 91% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. The storage during the corresponding period of last year was 83% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 68% of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. Thus, storage during current year is better than the storage of last year and is also better than the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Central region includes the States of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. There are 19 reservoirs under CWC monitoring having total live storage capacity of 44.45BCM. As per the total live storage available in these reservoirs is 38.60 BCM which is 87% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. The storage during the corresponding period of last year was 82% and average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period was 75% of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. Thus, storage during the current year is better than the storage of last year and is also better than the average storage of the last ten years during the corresponding period. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Southern region includes the States of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, AP&#038;TG (2combined projects in both states), Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. There are 36reservoirs under CWC monitoring having total live storage capacity of 52.81 BCM. As per the total live storage available in these reservoirs is 42.31 BCM which is 80% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. The storage during corresponding period of last year was 79% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 66% of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. Thus, storage during current year is better than the corresponding period of last year and is also better than the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period. </p>
