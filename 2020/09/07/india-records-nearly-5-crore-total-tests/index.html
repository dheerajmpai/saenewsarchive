The daily testing capacity has crossed 11.70 lakh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India&#8217;s cumulative tests are nearly 5 crore (4,95,51,507) as on date. 7,20,362 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As a result of the country-wide ramped up testing, 1,33,33,904 tests were conducted in the last two weeks alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Centre’s policies are continuously evolving in the larger global context. Following on the heels of several measures to facilitate wider testing by the people, recently the Union Government has issued the revised and updated Advisory which provides for the first time ‘Testing on Demand”. The States/UTs have also been given wider flexibilities to simplify modalities to enable higher levels of testing. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
<p style="text-align:justify">The daily testing average had been on a continuous upward incline from around 7 lakh tests being conducted per day in the 3rd week of August to 10 lakh tests per day in the 1st week of September.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Higher testing enables early identification of confirmed cases, which in turn leads to timely initiation of effective treatment in supervised home/facility isolation or in hospitals.  These measures aid faster and higher numbers of recovery, lower fatality and saving of more lives.</p>
