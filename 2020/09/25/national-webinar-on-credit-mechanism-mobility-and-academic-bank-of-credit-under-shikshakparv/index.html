All these freedoms and choices will come to the students through Academic Credit Bank (ABC). </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Prof. R.P.Tiwari talked about the role of ABC for creating a life-long learning society and various benefits it will accrue to the students. He emphasized that the main objectives of the ABC are to promote student centric higher education system and enable students to select courses and institutions; allow them to choose a pace for their studies to complete their degrees as per their choice.

<p style="text-align:justify">Prof. BhushanPatwardhan appreciatedthe attempts made by UGC in line with the NEP recommendations to liberate the Indian higher education from a slew of regulations and regulators. Academic Bank of Credits shall facilitate the integration of the campuses and distributed learning system, by creating student mobility within inter and intra university system.

<p style="text-align:justify">Prof. Thyagarajan during his course referred to the tradition knowledge system of India and felt that 64 Kalas and 14 Vidyas imparted in the ancient time are beingreintroduced in ABC. The ABC will lead to life-long learning by promoting learning and relearning cycles multiple times. He felt that through this concept higher education space will move from rigidity to flexibility, make students knowledge creators instead of users of knowledge and their holistic development and make them job creators rather than job seekers. The integration of skill education with the academic stream will improve the employability and lead to global citizen education.</p>
