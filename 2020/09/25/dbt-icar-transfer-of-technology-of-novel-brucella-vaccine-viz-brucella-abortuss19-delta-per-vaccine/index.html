Brucella abortusS19 delta per vaccine</h1><p style="text-align:justify">Department of Biotechnology (DBT), facilitated Transfer of Technology of novel Brucella vaccine viz. Brucella abortus S19 delta per vaccine, through Video Conferencing (VC), earlier this week and an MoU was signed.  This vaccine was developed by ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute (ICAR-IVRI), Izatnagar, Uttar Pradesh through a Network project on Brucellosis supported by DBT in which a gene was knocked out from Brucella abortus S19 strain. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This vaccine has confirmed protection against virulent challenge in experimental mice model conducted at IVRI, Izatnagar and in buffalo calves conducted at National Institute of Animal Health, an institute of Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying. The developed vaccine is also found to have DIVA compatible.  Brucella abortus S19 delta per vaccine can play an important role in National Brucellosis Control Programme initiated by Department of Animal Husbandry &#038; Dairying, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry &#038; Dairying, Government of India.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease which causes production losses in livestock.  The disease induces abortion at the last stage of pregnancy, infertility and other reproductive problem which causes losses in production of milk and meat.  Globally the disease is reported in approximately half a million human population every year.  In India huge population involved in dairy farming is directly affected with the Brucellosis.  </p>
