<p style="text-align:justify">Prof. Varghesefocused on the issues present in standard setting and accreditation.He covered various issues during his presentation. He said that the trend in many countries is to set ambitious standards and then using these standards to measure accountability. Standards are used to ensure that teachers and school are held responsible and that the teaching-learning process progresses systematically. NPE 1968 focused on creating school facilities, while NPE 1986 sought to create facilities in the classroom. It was in the 1990s that the concept of minimum levels of learning came to the forefront. He highlighted that there were two major issues that need to be addressed. First, students are not learning what they should be learning. Second, there is wide variation in what students are learning in different schools. Generally, surveys show that mostly private schools perform better than government schools, with the exception of KendriyaVidyalayas and NavodayaVidyalayas. Globally, there has been a shift from emphasis on schooling to learning. This has put pressure on schools. Parents prefer to send their children to private schools. Society&#8217;s demand on performance of schools and student has increased over time, he added. </p>
