Balasubrahmanyam</h1><p style="text-align:justify">The Vice President has condoled the demise of legendary musician, Shri S.P. Balasubrahmanyam. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Following is his full statement-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“I am shocked to learn of the tragic demise of S.P. Balasubrahmanyam whom I have known for a number of decades.  It is truly an irreparable loss to the world of music and a deeply emotional moment for me personally.  SPB or Balu as he was fondly called by his innumerable admirers came from Nellore, my native place. I have had immense admiration for him as I heard his rapturous melodies, his passionate love for his mother tongue and the extraordinary manner in which he groomed a whole generation of talented, young musicians.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He leaves a void in my heart and the hearts of millions of music lovers across the world. His mellifluous voice has been unfortunately muted by the vicious virus. However, his genial smile and infectious humour will remain etched in our memories.  His extraordinary renditions of songs will keep ringing in our ears and resonating in our consciousness for a very long time to come. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I pay me reverential homage to this legendary musician whom I have had the pleasure of knowing so closely.  I pray to the Almighty to give his family the strength to cope with this most unexpected loss”.</p>
