Once the application is received, it is processed immediately and permission is issued within the shortest possible time. In addition to this ASI’s online application system has been integrated with the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and National Film Development Corporation (NFDC)’s Film Facilitation Office (FFO) website www.ffo.gov.in which enables filmmakers to apply for permission to film in ASI owned monuments by creating an account on the FFO web portal. It is a single window facilitation and clearance mechanism to make the permission process more efficient and quicker. </p>
