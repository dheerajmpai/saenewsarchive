<p style="text-align:justify">This Rail Line will start from Palwal and end at existing Harsana Kalan station (On Delhi-Ambala section).  This will also give connectivity enroute to existing Patli Station (On Delhi-Rewari line), Sultanpur station (On Garhi Harsaru-Farukhnagar Line) and Asaudha Station (On Delhi Rohtak Line).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Implementation</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The project will be implemented by Haryana Rail Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (HRIDC), a Joint Venture company set up by Ministry of Railways with Government of Haryana. The project will have joint participation of Ministry of Railways, Government of Haryana and private stakeholders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Estimated completion cost of the project is Rs. 5,617 crore. The project is likely to be completed in 5 years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Benefits</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The districts of Palwal, Nuh, Gurugram, Jhajjar and Sonipat districts of Haryana will be benefitted through this rail line.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This will facilitate diversion of traffic not meant for Delhi thus decongesting NCR and will help in developing multimodal logistics hubs in Haryana State sub-region of NCR. It will provide high-speed seamless connectivity of this region to Dedicated Freight Corridor network resulting in reduction of cost and time of transportation for EXIM traffic from NCR to ports of India, making exports of goods more competitive. This efficient transport corridor along with other initiatives will provide enabling infrastructure to attract multinational industries to set up manufacturing units to fulfil the &#8216;Make in India&#8217; mission. The project will connect unserved areas of the state of Haryana, thereby boosting economic and social activities in Haryana State. This multipurpose transport project will also facilitate affordable and faster commuter travel, long distance travel in different directions from Gurugram and the industrial regions of Manesar, Sohna, Farukhnagar, Kharkhauda and Sonipat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Approximately 20,000 passengers each day will be travelling through this line and 50 Million Tonnes goods traffic would also be carried out every year.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Background</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Orbital Rail Corridor from Palwal to Sonipat by passing Delhi is a crucial infrastructure project for sustainable development of the National Capital Region and to decongest existing Indian Railway network in Delhi area. The alignment of this project is adjacent to the western peripheral (Kundli-Manesar-Palwal) Expressway and has been under consideration for some time. The project will have connectivity with all the existing Railway routes originating from Delhi and passing through Haryana State as well as with the Dedicated Freight Corridor network.</p>
