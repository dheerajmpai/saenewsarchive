Under DAPSC, certain percentage of funds are earmarked by Ministry/Department wise exclusively for the welfare of SCs, for implementing identified schemes/programmes. As per the Ministry of Finance guidelines, funds under the SC component are not re-appropriated to Non-SC heads. Besides, most State Governments and the Union Territory Administrations are also allocating part of their budget for the development of SCs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As per Census 2011, the total SC population in the country, including Uttar Pradesh, is 20.14 cr. which is 16.6% of the total population of the country. There is no provision for State-wise allocation of funds under DAPSC, however, the total funds allocated under various Schemes under DAPSC during the last three years and the current year is as below:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Year</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">2017-18</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">2018-19</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">2019-20</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">  2020-21</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">DAPSC Allocation</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In Rs.cr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">52605.81</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">56618.25</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">81340.74</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">83256.62</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The DAPSC allocation has been increasing on a year-to-year basis and its percentage to the total allocation under the identified schemes has been higher than the percentage of SC population in the country as per the Census 2011. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has developed an online-web portal (e-utthaan.gov.in) for monitoring the progress against financial, physical and outcome targets under the DAPSC. Nodal Officers have been appointed by the concerned Departments/Ministries to ensure better monitoring of the programme. Regular meetings are also held by this Ministry with the concerned Ministries/Departments to ensure proper utilization of the funds.</p>
