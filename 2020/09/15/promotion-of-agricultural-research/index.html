The institutes are developing and promoting high yielding varieties and technologies for higher production, reducing farm input (manpower, seed, fertilizer and water) and improving the income of farmers.</p>

Towards creation of new state of art infrastructure, Rajendra Agricultural University, Pusa, Bihar was upgraded to Dr. Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University. Two new institutes on the lines of Indian Agricultural Research Institute &#8211; Indian Agricultural Research Institute &#8211; Jharkhand and Indian Agricultural Research Institute &#8211; Assam were established. New colleges were started under Central Agricultural University, Imphal and Rani Laxmibai Central Agricultural University, Jhansi. Mahatma Gandhi Integrated Farming System Research Institute was established at Motihari, Bihar to provide holistic solution for the farming system in the flood prone areas. To improve the outreach of the ICAR among farming community of the country, 81 new Krishi Vigyan Kendras were established during the last 6 years taking the total number of KVKs upto 721.

<p style="text-align:justify">Due to the varieties of crops, improved breeds of livestock,  technologies and production practices developed by ICAR/NARS ably complemented by the programmes  and policies developed and implemented by the Government, the total production (2019-20) of food grains, pulses, oilseeds, sugarcane, horticultural produce, milk and fish has reached the mark of 295.67, 23.01, 33.50, 358.14, 313.35, 187.70 and 13.42 million tonnes per annum respectively thereby making India self-reliant or surplus in most of these commodities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Government has issued Guidelines for establishment of Central Agricultural Universities (CAU). These guidelines are available at https://icar.org.in/files/CAU-Guidelines-%202014-English%20.pdf</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> Government has also issued minimum requirements for establishment of new college in Agriculture and allied sciences. These requirements are available at  https://icar.org.in/files/MinimumRequirements_Final.pdf</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Currently there is no proposal for establishment of new agricultural universities in India.</p>
