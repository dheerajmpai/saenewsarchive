After filling the Form may be handed over to one of the said officials for registration of the case at the next Police Station irrespective of the jurisdiction for taking cognizance on it. If the place of occurrence does not fall in their jurisdiction, the case is registered under Zero FIR and transferred to the concerned Government Railway Police Station having jurisdiction. Further course of action is taken by the Police as per extant legal provisions. </p>
