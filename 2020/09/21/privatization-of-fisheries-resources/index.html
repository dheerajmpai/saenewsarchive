They exist in the form of marine capture fisheries resources, inland capture fisheries and aquaculture resources. These resources are spread over a range of different ecosystems. Fisheries and aquaculture being the State subject, utilisation of these resources are generally managed by the concerned States and UTs. The natural fisheries resources are available to the public and aquaculture has contributed to the development of the sector. Therefore, the issue of privatization of fisheries resources does not arise.</p>
