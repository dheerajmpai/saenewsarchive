Also, under the startup facilitation scheme, a list of facilitators is provided at Trade Marks Offices’ website (www.ipindia.nic.in) whose services may be availed by the startups for application for registration of trademark and the professional charges of such facilitators is reimbursed by the government.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">A trademark application is processed in accordance with The Trade Marks Act, 1999 and The Trade Marks Rules, 2017. The brief steps/stages for granting a trademark are as under:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The registration certificate for trademark is normally granted to the applicant within seven months from the date of filing of application, if no office objections are noted in examination and no opposition is received after publication of the trademarks application in the Trade Marks Journal. However, examination is being done in around one month time from the date of filing of the trademarks application.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">There is no strict time limit for granting a trademark, since the procedure for trademark registration is a quasi-judicial process as per the Trade Marks Act, 1999. Internal guidelines are issued from time to time for quick disposal of applications, and, if any deliberate dereliction of duty is found on the part of any officer, appropriate action is taken as per the CCS Rules.</p>
