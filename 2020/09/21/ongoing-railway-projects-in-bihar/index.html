<p style="text-align:justify">Completion of a Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities, statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site, due to climatic conditions, etc. and all these factors differ from project to project and affect the completion time of the project. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">To ensure that projects are completed in time without cost overrun, lot of monitoring is done in Railways at various levels (field level, Divisional level, Zonal level and Board level) and regular meetings are held with the officials of State Government and concerned authorities to resolve the pending issues obstructing the progress of projects. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Besides, to ensure that projects are completed even before time, Railway has adopted the concept of incentives to the contractor in the form of bonus clause in contracts, which will further enhance the pace of execution of projects. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Further, for capacity enhancement projects institutional financing has been arranged, which has increased Railways’ capacity for committed fund provision for capacity enhancement projects. </p>
