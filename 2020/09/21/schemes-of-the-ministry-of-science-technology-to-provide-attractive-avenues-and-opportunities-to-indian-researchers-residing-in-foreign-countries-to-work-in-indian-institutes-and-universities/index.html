<p style="text-align:justify">Ministry of Science and technology does not keep track or estimates the number of Indian scientists, who leave India to work in other countries. However, to avoid brain drain Ministry of Science and Technology is promoting global level of research through implementation of various competitive schemes / programmes such as Core Research Grant, Research fellowships such as JC Bose and Swarnajayanti fellowship etc. There are some special schemes for young scientists e.g. Start-up Research Grant, National Postdoctoral Fellowship etc. for making them independent and motivate them to remain in the country. Towards gaining global competitiveness Ministry of Science is also connecting Indian Research with Global research through International bilateral and multilateral S &#038; T cooperation with about 80 countries and various multilateral organizations/agencies.</p>
