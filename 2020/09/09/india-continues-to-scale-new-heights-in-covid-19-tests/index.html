More than 11.5 lakh COVID samples have been tested in the last 24 hours. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India is one of the few countries that have reported very high numbers of daily testing. The daily testing capacity has already crossed 11 lakh. With 11,54,549  tests conducted in the last 24 hours, India has further strengthened the national diagnostic capacity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">With this achievement, the cumulative tests have crossed 5.18 crore (5,18,04,677). </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Timely diagnosis through higher levels of country-wide testing has furnished valuable opportunities to isolate or hospitalize the positive cases adequately in advance for appropriate treatment. This in turn has facilitated lower mortality rates (1.69% today) and speedy recovery.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Expanded diagnostic lab network and facilitation for easy testing across the country through various calibrated measures have given a substantial boost. Building on this achievement, the Tests Per Million (TPM) have seen a sharp increase to 37,539. It continues to maintain the constant upward trend.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">From one testing lab in Pune in January 2020, today the country stands strengthened with 1678 labs including 1040 labs in the government sector and 638 private labs These include:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">• Real-Time RT PCR based testing labs: 854 (Govt: 469 + Private: 385)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">• TrueNat based testing labs: 703 (Govt: 537 + Private: 166)</p>
