The latest report of NCRP is for the year 2020, which is based on data for the period 2012-16, as compared to earlier report of 2016, which was based on data for the period 2012-14. Also, the year 2020 report is based on an increased coverage in terms of more number of Population Based Cancer Registries (PBCRs) or expansion of some existing PBCRs. As a result of above changes, the annual figures of estimated incidence of cancer in the country in the year 2020 report have undergone revision as compared to previous report of NCRP of 2016, and the revised year-wise figures are as under:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Year</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">2017</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">2018</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">2019</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Estimated Incidence of Cancer Cases</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">12,92,534</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">13,25,232</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">13,58,415</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Public Health and Hospitals is a State subject. The Central Government, however, supplements the efforts of the State Governments to prevent and control cancer and to provide affordable and accessible care. The Government is implementing National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS), with focus on strengthening infrastructure, human resource development, health promotion &#038; awareness generation, early diagnosis, management and referral to an appropriate level institution for treatment. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Under NPCDCS, Population level initiative for prevention, control and screening for common NCDs (diabetes, hypertension and common cancers viz. oral, breast and cervical cancer) is also being implemented across the country including Lakshadweep. Financial assistance is also provided to the Government of Lakshadweep through Programme Implementation Plan (PIP) for population based screening including early detection of cancer. Under this initiative, persons above 30 years of age are targeted for screening for common NCDs by trained frontline workers at Heath &#038; Wellness Centres/ Primary Health Centres/ Sub-centres. Screening of common NCDs including three common cancers i.e. oral, breast and cervical is also an integral part of service delivery under Ayushman Bharat &#8211; Health and Wellness Centres. Population based screening helps in mass awareness generation about risk factors and early detection of NCDs including common cancers. UT Administration of Lakshadweep has informed that Primary Health Centre (PHC) Kalpeni, PHC Kiltan, PHC Chetlath have been converted to Health &#038; Wellness Centres and cancer screening has been initiated in these islands. Further, the UT Administration organized mass screening campaign for early detection of carcinoma breast, oral cancers and cervical cancers for eligible population at island of Amni.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Awareness campaigns on common risk factors for NCDs, including cancer, and for promotion of healthy lifestyle are also carried out through print, electronic and social media. Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Cancer Prevention and Research (NICPR), Noida, has launched www.cancerindia.org  with the theme “India Against Cancer”, a portal that provides information on the leading cancers in India with a major focus on awareness, prevention and treatment of these cancers.</p>
