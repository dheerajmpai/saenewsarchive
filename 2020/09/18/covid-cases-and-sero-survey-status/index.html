It is 3445 for India as compared to 19295 for USA, 20146 for Brazil, 7283 for Russian Federation and 10929 for South Africa. However, cases per million population for India is high as compared to other countries in South East Asia</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The low case fatality in India can be attributed to early case detection through community-based surveillance, containment measures including strict perimeter control, house-to-house case search &#038; follow-up with  monitoring of oxygen saturation, early referral to COVID treatment facilities and adequate case management. </p>
