<p style="text-align:justify">With a view to support and facilitate investments into India, the Government is working hard to institutionalize more investor friendly reforms.  The Government has constituted an Empowered Group of Secretaries (EGoS) to provide support and facilitation to investors for investing in India and to boost growth in key sectors of the economy.  EGoS shall identify potential investors/organizations, make recommendations to the Ministry/Department to promote investment, facilitate handholding of investors, examine and suggest ways to attract more investment in greenfield projects.  Project Development Cells (PDCs) are being set up in Ministries/Departments to fast track investments with coordination between Central Government Ministries and State Governments and thereby grow the pipeline of investment projects in India.  The entire focus of the Government is to create an investment-friendly and business conducive ecosystem to drive investment growth in India.  Several steps like Production Investment Schemes, GIS mapping of available land banks, issuance of Quality Control Orders to cut down cheap imports and many such measures have been put into place to attract further investment into the country.</p>
