The recommendations are done by an independent National Jury composed of eminent environmentalists &#038; scientists. Blue Flag beaches are considered the cleanest beaches of the world. The eight beaches are Shivrajpur in Gujarat, Ghoghla in Daman&#038;Diu, Kasarkod and Padubidri beach in Karnataka, Kappad in Kerala, Rushikonda in Andhra Pradesh, Golden beach of Odisha and Radhanagar beach in Andaman and Nicobar.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">With a view to protect and conserve the coastal and marine ecosystems and environment through a holistic coastal management, the Ministry of Environment, Forests &#038; Climate Change launched the Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) activities in India for a holistic approach with an interactive, dynamic, multidisciplinary, and iterative planning process to promote sustainable development &#038; management of coastal zones through its own wing SICOM.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The concept of ICZM was introduced in 1992 during the Earth Summit at Rio de Janeiro and most of the coastal countries in the World have been adopting ICZM principles for managing their coastal zones. Thus, adoption of ICZM principles for managing and sustainably developing our coastal regions is helping India in keeping with its commitments to international agreements on ICZM.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The objective of BEAMS program is to abate pollution in coastal waters, promote sustainable development of beach facilities, protect &#038; conserve coastal ecosystems &#038; natural resources, and seriously challenge local authorities &#038; stakeholders to strive and maintain high standards of cleanliness, hygiene &#038; safety for beachgoers in accordance with coastal environment &#038; regulations. This program promotes beach recreation in absolute harmony with nature.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">International Coastal Cleanup Day got its start in 1986 when Linda Maraniss met Kathy O’Hara while working for Ocean Conservancy. O’Hara had just completed a report called Plastics in the Ocean: More Than a Litter Problem. The two of them reached out to other ocean-lovers and organized a Cleanup for Ocean Conservancy. The first Cleanup consisted of 2,800 volunteers. Since that time, the Cleanup has grown into an international event in more than 100 countries.</p>
