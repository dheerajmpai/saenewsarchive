<p style="text-align:justify">Further, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), an autonomous organisation of the Department of Health Research, has informed that the stages of vaccine development include the following steps:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">i. Identification and development of an appropriate vaccine strain which may be safe and immunogenic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">ii. Full characterization of the vaccine strain by in-vitro experiments. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">iii. Pre-clinical studies in small animals like rats, mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters etc. These are safety and dose determination studies. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">iv. Preclinical studies in large animals (depending upon feasibility and availability) to determine safety, protective efficacy and potential dose and formulation. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">v. Phase I human clinical trials which establish the safety of the product. The numbers are usually < 100. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">vi. Phase II human clinical trials to determine the immunogenicity or immune protection. The numbers are usually < 1000. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">vii. Phase III human clinical trials to determine the efficacy. The numbers range in several thousands. After successful completion of phase III studies, regulatory approval is accorded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">viii. Phase IV or post marketing surveillance studies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">CDSCO has informed that it has not received any report regarding such deviation from the standard procedures in research and development of vaccine for Coronavirus.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) has informed that it has granted test license permission for manufacture of COVID-19 Vaccine for preclinical test, examination and analysis to the following manufacturers in India:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), an autonomous organisation under the Department of Health Research, has informed that it is facilitating the following studies related to COVID-19 vaccines:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">(i) An inactivated whole virion candidate vaccine (BBV152) for SARS-CoV-2 has been developed by Bharat Biotech International Ltd (BBIL) using the virus isolate (NIV-2020-770) provided by ICMR-National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. Characterization of the vaccine candidate has been undertaken at ICMR-NIV followed by safety and tolerability studies in small animals like rats, mice and rabbits. Status of clinical trials is as follows: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">(ii) A DNA vaccine (ZyCov-D) has been developed by Cadila Healthcare Ltd. Pre- clincial toxicity studies were conducted in small animals: mice, rats, rabbits and guinea pigs. The vaccine has been found to be safe and immunogenic. Cadila has partnered with ICMR for conduct of parallel pre-clinical studies in rhesus macaques. Status of clinical trials is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">(iii) Serum Institute of India (SII) and ICMR have partnered for clinical development of two global vaccine candidates:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">           As per details provided by Department of Biotechnology (DBT)/Department of Science and Technology (DST), more than 30 vaccine candidates have been supported which are in different stages of development. </p>
