<p style="text-align:justify">Similarly in case of ventilators, within a very short span of time, indigenous production capacity has increased to 3 lakh per annum. In addition, India did not face any scarcity of medicines, prices of medicines remained stable throughout.

The objective is to make India self reliant in production of 53 critical APIs or Key Starting Materials (KSMs), and in production of medical devices, for which India is crucially dependent upon imports. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Gowda said that he is very much sure  that these  parks will be able to attract significant investment as well as latest technology.  Within a period of 2 -3 years, due to business friendly policies of Union Government under leadership of Shri Narendra Modi, pharma sector will become atmanirbhar, not only in sense of meeting domestic requirements but also for fulfilling global demand of low cost &#8211; high quality medicines and medical devices. It is expected that these schemes of Union Government for development of bulk drug &#038; medical device park will attract cumulative investment of Rs 78000 crore and can generate about 2.5 lakh employment. </p>
