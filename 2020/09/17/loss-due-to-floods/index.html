The occurrence of floods can be attributed to various factors, including wide variations in rainfall both in time and space with frequent departures from the normal pattern, inadequate carrying capacities of rivers, river bank erosion and silting of river beds, landslides, poor natural drainage in flood prone areas, snowmelt and glacial lake out-bursts. The schemes for anti-erosion works, construction of new embankments and raising/strengthening of existing and protection of embankments are formulated and implemented by concerned States as per their priority. The Union Government supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical guidance and also promotional financial assistance for management of floods in critical areas. As informed by Irrigation and Water Resource Department, Government of Uttar Pradesh no water flows into Gomti River from bordering area of Nepal and there is no major loss reported during flood in the Gomti River. </p>
