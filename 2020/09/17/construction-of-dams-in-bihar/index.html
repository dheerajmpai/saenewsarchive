In order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Government of India provides technical and financial assistance to encourage sustainable development and efficient management of water resources through various schemes and programmes such as Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP) etc. under Pradhan MantriKrishiSinchayeeYojana (PMKSY) as per the guidelines of such schemes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As intimated by the Central Water Commission (CWC), no Major and Medium Irrigation Project proposal including construction of dams in Mithila Region/ Darbhanga district of Bihar has been received from the State Govt during last five years. However, it received a proposal of Dagmara Hydro Electric Project from Central Electricity Authority (CEA) on 12th June, 2020 for clearance from inter-state aspects. The same was accepted by CWC on 24th June, 2020. The project is a Run of the River scheme with installed capacity of 130.1 MW and envisages constructions of concrete barrage and earthen dam across Kosi River in Mithila region of Bihar.</p>
