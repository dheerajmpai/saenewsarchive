<p style="text-align:justify">Details:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The approval would facilitate POWERGRID, a Central Public Sector Enterprise under Ministry of Power, to undertake asset monetization of its identified TBCB transmission assets through InvIT, so that the proceeds from the asset monetization could be utilized for fresh investment in the transmission network expansion and other capital schemes of the company.

<p style="text-align:justify">The assets proposed for monetization through InvlT are operational assets proposed to be managed by the existing manpower of POWERGRID already deputed for this purpose and therefore no additional employment generation is envisaged with regard to them.
