The MoU was signed by Prof. (Dr.) Harish Hirani, Director, CSIR-CMERI, Durgapur and Dr. Arun Kumar Tripathy, Director-General, NISE. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">After the astounding success of the World’s largest Solar Tree of 11.5 kWp, CSIR-CMERI intend to further its efforts towards strengthening the Renewable Energy commitments. CSIR-CMERI has expertise in design and development of various capacity Solar Artifacts for multifaceted uses ranging from fulfilling localized energy demand to boosting Agricultural sector for irrigation, solar powered agro dryer, de-centralized solar cold storage, charging of battery operated agricultural machineries etc. It’s expertise in the domain of Solar Converter and Conditioning unit &#038; Isolated Minigrid will also aid this collaboration. The institute is currently working on the development of Solar Energy based cooking system which will help in creating an energy reliant and carbon-neutral India in addition to the upliftment of the livelihood of the rural sector in India.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">National Institute of Solar Energy (NISE), an autonomous centre of excellence of Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Government of India, is engaged in Solar PV/Thermal R&#038;D, Testing, Demonstration Projects, Skill Development, Consultancy, Innovation and Incubation etc. The Institute is equipped with advance equipment to carry out testing and certification of different Solar PV/Thermal gadgets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">            The MoU is intended to achieve the following objectives:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Prof. (Dr.) Harish Hirani, Director, CSIR-CMERI, Durgapur on this occasion stated that this joint venture is significant to cater to the need of ‘National Integrity’ for achievement of common goals and objectives related to R&#038;D, Implementation, Consultancy Services and Promotion of Solar PV System, Micro Grid Initiatives, Energy Storage Systems, Power Converter and Conditioning Systems, Solar Thermal Energy System, Solar Cooking and Electric Vehicles etc. This will be a step towards a comprehensive electrification of India. This would also lead to optimum sharing of resources as well as public funds. The MoU is signed with an aim to improve resource sharing and coordination between the NISE and CSIR-CMERI for effective utilisation of the national resources eliminating the duplicity of further capital investment for the same resource.  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dr. Arun Kumar Tripathi, DG, NISE while speaking on the occasion said that the MoU is going to benefit both the institutions working on the overall promotion of solar energy in the country. He reiterated that the MoU will pave the way for exchange of knowledge, capacity building and joint research project in the field of Solar Energy. He appreciated and expressed his eagerness to collaborate with CSIR-CMERI especially after the quantum leaps made by the Institute in the field of solar energy.  </p>
