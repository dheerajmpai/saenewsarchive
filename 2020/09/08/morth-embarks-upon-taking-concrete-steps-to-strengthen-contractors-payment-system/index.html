Conciliation Committees have been formed consisting of Independent Experts (CCIEs) for this purpose. All contractors are being called for conciliations for expeditious settlement of their claims and get their payments released immediately. 47 cases involving claims of Rs. 14,248 Crore have been settled during this year. Discussions are underway on another 59 cases.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The annual Annuity obligations for NHAI are approx. Rs 5000 crore. All Annuities payments are made in time. In HAM projects, NHAI provides 40 per cent of the Bid Project Cost as Construction Support based on achievement of Milestone. Whenever the milestones are achieved, payments are made quickly. The Grant /VGF towards BOT (Toll) Projects are paid as per the terms of the Concession Agreement and depends on many factors including physical progress, equity and debt infusion. There are no overdue payments pending with NHAI. Various systems have been introduced for immediate payment of dues. Special efforts were made and over Rs ten thousand crore were disbursed towards various payments in the first nine days of nationwide lockdown.</p>
