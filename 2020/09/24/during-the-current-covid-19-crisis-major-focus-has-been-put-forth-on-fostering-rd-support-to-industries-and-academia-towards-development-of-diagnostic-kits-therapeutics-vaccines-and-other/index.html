In past few months, major focus has been put forth on fostering R&#038;D support to industries and academia towards development of diagnostic kits, therapeutics, vaccines and other interventions like efficient sanitization methods, facial mask, Contactless Digital Sanitation etc. The budget allocated to different schemes for R&#038;D is Rs.379.53 Crore. The details of these activities are given in Annexure-A.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The technological interventions supported through various Ministries and their Departments in terms of diagnostics, therapeutics, PPEs, masks, sanitizers etc. are being used across the</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">country in order to protect people from this COVID virus.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The various PPE, Masks and Diagnostic kits have been deployed across the country including the Government offices.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The I-lab was launched by the Minister S&#038;T, MoHFW &#038; MoES on 18thJun 2020. This can perform both RT-PCR and ELISA tests. The first lab is attached to THSTI hub and had performed about 5000 tests in the Faridabad region. The Department is supporting17 proposals in the area of Diagnostics with a total cost of 1000.93 lakhs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">2. Therapeutics: Considering the present COVID crisis, the Department is supporting 13 proposals in the area of Therapeutics with a total cost of Rs. 964.035 Lakhs. Of these, some of the targeted leads are very much promising.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">3. Vaccine: Recognizing the critical requirement for a safe and efficacious vaccine for COVID-19, in effective control of the pandemic, the Government of India, is supporting vaccine development activities. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Currently, nearly 30 vaccine candidates for COVID-19, based on multiple technologies / platforms are under development in India, by both academia and industry. Of these, the Department of Biotechnology is supporting 8 proposals by industry and 2 by academia for candidate vaccine development and associated research resources. A total cost of INR 75 crore has been allocated for supporting vaccine development efforts. Availability of vaccine is subject to successful completion of Phase III clinical trials.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">4. Other interventions: In the area of Other Interventions, the Department is supporting 5 proposals with a total cost of Rs. 86.88 Lakhs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">5. Herbal Formulations: The Department is implementing3 Sub-Networks under “DBT-AYUSH Network Programme on R&#038;D Activities related to SARS-CoV-2 Virus and COVID-19 Disease” at a total cost of Rs.595.44 lakhs to be shared equally by DBT and National Medicinal Plants Board (NMPB), Ministry of AYUSH with an aim to screen selected traditional knowledge-based medicinal plants and classical formulations for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities in cell culture models of virus infection. Studies are also planned to be carried out on preclinical and pharmacokinetics evaluation of selected AYUSH herbal extracts / formulations for mitigating SARS-CoV2 and associated pathologies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Department in collaboration with Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">(BIRAC) announced a Joint call on &#8220;Anti- SARS-CoV-2 /nCoV-2 Virus Studies using Botanical Ingredients and Traditional Formulations&#8221;. Under this call, total 229 proposals were received for further processing.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">FELUDA: CSIR-IGIB has developed indigenous novel Covid-19 diagnostic kit called FELUDA (FNCAS9 Editor-Linked Uniform Detection Assay), a CRISPR-Cas9 based test licensed to TATA Sons. FELUDA has been approved by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI). This is the only third CRISPR based technology in the world to obtain regulatory approval for the detection of Coronavirus. The other methods using Cas12 and Cas13 proteins were developed by scientists at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) and MIT in the USA. This method uses the FnCAS9 enzyme which was characterized and adapted for Covid19 detection at CSIR-IGIB. The detection relies on a simple visual readout using paper-based detection chemistry. It is rapid, sensitive and specific. The entire method takes up to an hour, does not need high-end instrumentation and can aid in scaling up the testing quickly in the country.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">to generate data on acceptance and usage of AYUSH advocacies and measures among the</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">population and its impact in prevention of COVID-19 targeting 05 million populations. This mobile app is also having advisories related to need for self-care measures for immunity boosting and various Ayurvedic immunity promoting measures during COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">D. Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR): has validated 866 diagnostic commodities</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">for COVID-19. Out of this, 443 have been approved. Additionally, alternate indigenous</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">testing platforms like TrueNat and CBNAAT have also been validated and approved for use.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">These platforms have improved access to testing at district and primary health center level.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Also, newer Rapid Antigen Tests have been validated and approved for use. This has</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">increased access to testing at field level. Indigenization of technologies for COVID-19 testing as well as handholding of indigenous manufacturers has tremendously helped in upscaling testing in India. </p>
