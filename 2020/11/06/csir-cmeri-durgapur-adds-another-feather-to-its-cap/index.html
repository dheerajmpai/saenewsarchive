<p style="text-align:justify">Prof. (Dr.) Hirani, in his address remarked, “This MoU with IDTR is a result of the experience garnered from all the existing MoUs entered into by CSIR-CMERI. IDTR will be a sort of an extended Manufacturing arm for the CSIR-CMERI, to ensure that its technologies have maximum outreach across the Nation. CSIR-CMERI is working with its potential towards the import substitution and when the two such institutions join hands, the optimum potential would grow to make an Atmanirbhar Bharat. Mutual cooperation in the skill development programmes is therefore sought for so that the unemployment in the youngsters could be tackled properly and the technological developments are taken ahead. We need to reduce the existing logistic costs in the industries by setting up of smaller industrial units at nearer places.”  Both CSIR-CMERI and IDTR possess immense value-addition potentials for the industry as well as the society. If executed comprehensively, the MoU may help expand the sphere of influence of both the organisations and spur the nation towards achieving optimum economic growth. The assets, both physical and human resources, that public-funded organisations like CSIR-CMERI and IDTR possesses, may provide a golden opportunity for the MSMEs to utilise and further their interests. The joining hands of such apex institutions will help the micro and small enterprises, start-ups and small businesses by providing them with Technology Consultations and Manufacturing Facilitation.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Director, CSIR-CMERI further stated, “Since different Institutions are trying their best to deliver their mandated tasks, networking amongst these institutes will create an ecosystem, which will provide a win-win situation for the MSMEs. Linking of the Financial Services to the MSMEs through networking will also provide the necessary capital back-up. Such collaborations will ultimately benefit India, society and the involved Institutions. CSIR-CMERI has developed some big technologies in the domain of Municipal Solid Waste and Hospital Waste Management, Farm Mechanization, Water Purification also, which has the potential to positively influence the lives of hundreds of millions across the Nation.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Anand Dayal, Managing Director, IDTR, Jamshedpur, in his address stated, “CSIR-CMERI being the best Institution in the country in the domain of Mechanical Engineering will be able to provide critical technology support in the spheres of Agricultural Machinery, Toy Industry and Incense Manufacturing Clusters. One of the potential biggest areas of technology intervention for CSIR-CMERI can be in the domain of Industry 4.0 through next-generation concepts such as Additive Manufacturing, 3D Printing (Metal and Polymers), Internet-of-Things, Artificial Intelligence and Maximized Automation of Mechanical Processes. Through maximum interactions between IDTR and CSIR-CMERI, on-Site skilling in the remotest corners of the country may be facilitated over time. Three products developed by IDTR has not only helped substitute imports but has also radically reduced its cost. The AL-90 Slide Gates is the most prominent among them and IDTR also plans to encourage the MSMEs to boost its manufacturing capacities, so that they are steadily able to export the same.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It is to be mentioned that a team from IDTR will soon be visiting CSIR-CMERI to understand and explore possible avenues for its deployment in various Industry paradigms”</p>
