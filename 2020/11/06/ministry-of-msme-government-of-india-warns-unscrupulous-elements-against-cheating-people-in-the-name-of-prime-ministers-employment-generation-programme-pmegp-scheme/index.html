<p style="text-align:justify">In a statement issued today, Ministry of MSME has informed that some instances are reported to the Ministry that potential entrepreneurs / beneficiaries are being approached by private persons or agencies offering loans under PMEGP Scheme and handing over loan sanction letters and cheating the entrepreneurs by charging money from them.

<p style="text-align:justify">Under the PMEGP Scheme, the entire process of application and fund flow right from receipt of application to sanction and release of loan by banks to the applicants has been made online through only one Government portal run by Khadi and Village Industries Commission. The portal can be accessed at https://www.kviconline.gov.in/pmeepeportal/pmegphome/index.jsp. The whole process is totally free of cost.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">No Private Party/Agency/ Middlemen/ Franchise, etc. is engaged or authorized for promoting and sanctioning PMEGP Projects or providing any financial assistance under PMEGP scheme.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Instances of potential entrepreneurs / beneficiaries being approached by private persons or agencies offering loans under PMEGP Scheme and handing over loan sanction letters and cheating the entrepreneurs by charging money from them is totally illegal and absolutely fake. General public is therefore advised to remain cautious of such unscrupulous elements.</p>
