The Committee had earlier submitted two interim reports covering banking and insurance and in the final report it included recommendations on Capital Markets. The terms of reference of the Committee were to create a roadmap for the development of international retail business in the IFSC and also make other suggestions. The Committee also made recommendations for the overall development of the IFSC. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Committee highlighted the opportunity for FinServ from India and taking India global through the IFSC. The Committee suggested that IFSCA should balance a robust regulatory framework with ease of doing business and aim to benchmark itself with the best-in-class jurisdictions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It suggested that, there is immediate potential to promote international retail business in the IFSC, it will meet the three key objectives: a) boosting job creation, b) generating additional revenue for India, and c) attracting funds (especially from the Indian Diaspora) for building India’s infrastructure.  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In light of the duty enjoined on the IFSCA by the International Financial Services Centres Act, 2019, the Committee outlined the dual role of IFSCA of development and regulation and stressed that the role of development would be critical in the initial years as IFSCA builds a conducive ecosystem for financial institutions to operate in the IFSC.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Injeti Srinivas, Chairman IFSCA said &#8221; Our Vision is to develop the IFSC in India into a leading Global Financial Centre having strong connect with global markets. A huge domestic economy and around 30 mn strong Indian diaspora globally would help IFSC to emerge as a dominant gateway for global capital flows into and out of the country.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Pradip Shah, Chairman of the Committee, said &#8220;As a greenfield IFSC and with a new regulatory body, there is also an opportunity for the IFSCA to set a new global benchmark by providing an environment that fosters innovation in financial products and services and the development of financial technology solutions on the back of a progressive regulatory framework and a conducive work environment. The IFSC, with its approach of ‘FinServe from India’, will complement the ‘Make in India’ vision of the Government of India (GoI).&#8221;</p>
