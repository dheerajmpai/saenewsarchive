Singh and other officials were also present on the occasion. Shri M Venkaiah Naidu gave his compliments to the Jal Shakti Ministry and congratulated all the States, institutions, organisations, individuals and others for their contribution to the cause of water conservation. He said that through National Water Awards, Jal Andolan is being transformed into a Jan Andolan. &#8220;Without the people&#8217;s participation nothing will succeed; we saw that in Swachh Bharat Abhiyan,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Vice President complimented Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi for taking various initiatives like Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and Jal Shakti Abhiyan. The Vice President said that he was delighted to know that the categories of the Awards include all stakeholders. &#8220;It is our duty to take all possible steps for conservation of this limited resource and there is an urgent need for a sustained mass media campaign to aware people about the importance of water conservation,&#8221; Shri Naidu added. He also emphasized on the need to reduce wastage of water and said that need of the hour is to change our lifestyle and make water conservation a way of life. Good governance has been placed at the forefront of the country’s development agenda. The positive results of NamamiGange Programme, the expeditious completion of irrigation projects under Pradhan MantriKrishiSinchaiYojana, a renewed participatory approach towards groundwater management through Atal BhujalYojana, the improvement in availability of hydrological data through National Hydrology Project and National Project on Aquifer Management exemplify the holistic transformation India’s water sector has undergone in the past few years. A much-needed policy reform was undertaken at the highest level with the creation of Jal Shakti Ministry to give impetus to integrated management of water resources in India with special focus on demand side and supply side management.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He said that, commendably, the policy planners made judicious and active interventions at multiple levels to address individual elements of water management. Soon after the creation of the Jal Shakti Ministry, Jal Jeevan Mission was launched to provide a functional tap to every household by 2024. Parallelly, Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA), an aggressive and time-bound water conservation campaign was carried out from July to December 2019 covering 256 districts across India. JSA aims at making water conservation a Jan Andolan through asset creation and extensive communication. JSA is vigorously supplemented by the activities of National Water Mission to augment the overall growth of water consciousness in the country by emphasizing on the importance of water conservation, reuse and recharge and raise awareness on the indispensability of water as a resource. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He said that micro-irrigation practices like drip and sprinkler systems have to be promoted in a big way for efficient use of water for agriculture. Reduce, Reuse and Recycle must be the watch-words if we have to handover a liveable planet to the future generations. Watershed development is another area that can spur local economic development, job creation, biodiversity protection and climate resilience. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He congratulated all the winners and hoped that they will continue to do good work in water conservation. He also thanked the Ministry of Jal Shakti for organizing these Awards which not only motivate more and more people to do their but for the wonderful cause of water conservation but also act as a national platform to bring together and acknowledge some outstanding works being done across the country. Shri Naidu said that this platform also offers a window for new perspectives and directions in the area of water resources and expressed confidence that steps like these will go a long way in the development of water consciousness in the country, which is the need-of-the-hour.</p>
