This decision would come as a major relief to taxpayers of Jammu &#038; Kashmir and Ladakh who faced genuine difficulties in availing the Scheme during the original period of operation. The extension gives these taxpayers a fresh opportunity to settle their past tax disputes. This decision to extend the period for availing the Scheme for the taxpayers of the UT of Jammu &#038; Kashmir and UT of Ladakh would provide them a level playing field with the thousands of other taxpayers across the country who took the advantage of the Scheme.
