<p style="text-align:justify">The active cases have dropped to only 6.97% of the total positive cases of the country demonstrating a steady falling percentage of the total cases.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This sustained achievement is the result of collaborative action by States/UTs under the Centre&#8217;s strategy of comprehensive testing, timely tracking, quick hospitalization and adherence to the Standard Treatment Protocol which has ensured a standardised quality of medical care across the public and private hospitals and for the home isolation cases.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The trajectory of the active caseload across different States/UTs has been diverse demonstrating their focused efforts and gradual progress in their fight against COVID19. Karnataka has reported a steep decline in the active cases in the past 24 hours.</p>
