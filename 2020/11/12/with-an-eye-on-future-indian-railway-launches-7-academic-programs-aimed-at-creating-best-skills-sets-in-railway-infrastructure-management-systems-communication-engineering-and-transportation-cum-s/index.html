It intends to develop a set of core values—dedication to nation building, commitment to innovation and academic excellence, compassion towards people and society and responsibility towards the environment. It offers  project-based learning at Railway establishments. Indian Railways will be at the core of implementing the key features of the programmes. It will serve as an experiential learning laboratory for the student community as well as the faculty development initiatives, thereby creating a distinct character for the University: through a highly experiential and application-based learning approach.
