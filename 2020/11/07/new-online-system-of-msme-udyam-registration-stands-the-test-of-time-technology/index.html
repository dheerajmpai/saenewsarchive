<p style="text-align:justify">It may be stated that Ministry of MSME had revised the definition of MSMEs and process of registration w.e.f. 1st July, 2020. It also launched a new portal for MSME/Udyam registration (https://udyamregistration.gov.in). Since then, the portal is working smoothly.  In a major first, this portal is seamlessly integrated with CBDT and GST networks  as also with the GeM. It may  be noted that through this integration, now MSME registration is a totally paperless exercise. </p>

Similarly, all District Magistrates and District Industries Centers have been requested to expedite registration by the MSMEs. Grievances of MSMEs relating to registration are being handled by CHAMPIONS’ platform through its network of Central Control Room and 68 State Control Rooms across the country. </p>
