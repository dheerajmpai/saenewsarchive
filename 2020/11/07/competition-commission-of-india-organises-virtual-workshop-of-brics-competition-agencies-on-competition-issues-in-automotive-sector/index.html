In accordance with this MoU, four Working Groups had been constituted on important industries/ sectors viz Pharmaceuticals, Food, Automotive and Digital Markets. These Working Groups have collaborated with each other to adopt best practices. The present Workshop was held amongst the AWG. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Chairperson CCI, Shri Ashok Kumar Gupta, in his opening remarks stressed upon the importance and growth of the automobile sector in developing countries, especially the BRICS nations. He mentioned that the presence of numerous Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) within BRICS, due to existing congenial factors for production and assembly plants, makes such market a favorite destination for leading OEMs to tap enormous potential. The Chairperson suggested that the market regulators certainly do not want to be the speed bumps in the way of this industry but on the other hand have to be pro-active to flag competition concerns, that simply cannot be ignored.  He mentioned that a plausible common solution, may emerge due to the presence of most of the global automobile players in BRICS jurisdiction, thereby focusing on common approaches and standardisation. He highlighted the imperative need to discuss and reflect on the emerging issues, including relating to big data, in this sector.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Workshop was also addressed by Secretary CCI, Smt. Jyoti Jindgar Bhanot with her welcome remarks.
