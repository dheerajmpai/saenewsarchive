<p style="text-align:justify">Speaking about the initiative Union Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Shri. Kiren Rijiju said, &#8220;Creating centres of sporting excellence across the country is a step towards our vision of making India one of the top 10 countries in Olympics 2028. Unless we can provide world-class specialised training, we cannot expect athletes to excel at the Olympics. Each of these centers will provide world-class training in a specific sporting discipline and will become the main facility in the country where elite athletes of that sport will train. I am happy that each state has supported this initiative of the center with great positivity and enthusiasm.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The support to the centers will be in the form of infrastructure upgradation, setting up of sports science centres and also soft component in the form of quality coaches and sports science human resources like physiotherapists, strength &#038; conditioning experts and so on.  High quality equipments will also be provided to the players. The academy will also have High performance Manager to ensure quality of sports science input and performance management.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Sports Ministry is upgrading existing sporting infrastructure in each State and Union Territory, in partnership with the state and UT, and creating KISCEs with the aim of creating a robust sporting ecosystem in the entire country. Each KISCE will be extended with sports-specific support in 14 Olympic sports, out of which one state or UT will be given support for a maximum of three sports.</p>
