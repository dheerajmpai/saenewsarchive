The plant transported 3,186 Metric tonnes (MT) of dry fly ash in 51 BCCW wagons to Rajshree Cement (a unit of Ultratech Cement) Kalburgi in the state of Karnataka. With this mega initiative, NTPC Mauda has become the first power plant of NTPC in the state of Maharashtra to send a massive amount of dry fly ash through rail.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">During the financial year 2019-20, almost 23.57 lakh metric tonnes of fly ash was utilised for various productive purposes by NTPC Mauda. The power plant produces approximately 24-25 lakh metric tonnes of ash annually. Presently, 100% of ash is being utilised for the production of cement and fly ash bricks, construction of road embankment, development of low-lying land, and raising of ash dyke.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In its endeavour towards 100% utilisation of the by-product produced during power generation, India’s largest power producer, NTPC Ltd, has started collaborating with cement manufacturers around the country to supply fly ash. The power producer is leveraging Indian Railways’ sprawling network to transport fly ash in an economical and environment-friendly manner.</p>
