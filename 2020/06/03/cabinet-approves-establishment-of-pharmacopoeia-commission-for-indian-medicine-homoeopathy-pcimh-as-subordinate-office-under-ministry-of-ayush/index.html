<p style="text-align:justify">Presently, Pharmacopoeia Commission for Indian Medicine &#038; Homoeopathy (PCIM&#038;H) is an autonomous body under the aegis of Ministry of AYUSH established since 2010. The merger is aimed at optimizing the use of infrastructural facilities, technical manpower and financial resources of the three organizations for enhancing the standardization outcomes of Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and Homoeopathy drugs towards their effective regulation and quality control.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This merger will facilitate focused and cohesive development of standards of AYUSH drugs and publication of pharmacopoeias and formularies. It is also intended to accord legal status to the merged structure of PCIM&#038;H and its laboratory by virtue of making necessary amendment and enabling provisions in the Drugs &#038; Cosmetics Rules, 1945. Consultation in this regard has been done with the Director General Health Services, Drugs Controller General and Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani Drugs Technical Advisory Board (ASUDTAB), which is a statutory body under the provisions of Drugs &#038; Cosmetics Act, 1940 meant for advising Central and State Governments in regulatory matters of ASLT drugs. Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance has concurred the proposal of realigning the posts and hierarchical structure of the merged organisations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">PLIM &#038; HPL being the subordinate offices and PCIM&#038;H- an autonomous organization under Ministry of AYUSH are going to be merged to establish PCIM&#038;H, as a subordinate office of the Ministry with a common administrative control. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Post-merger PCIM&#038;H will have adequate administrative structure under the Ministry to strive for augmenting the capacity and outcomes of pharmacopoieal work, achieving harmonization of pharmacopoeial standards of Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and Homoeopathy drugs, preventing duplication and overlapping of drug standardization work and optimal utilization of resources in effective manner.</p>
