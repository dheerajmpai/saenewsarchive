<p style="text-align:justify">Students preferring Hindi medium were requesting to launch papers in Hindi language in order to help in their preparation. Keeping this in mind NTA has launched this feature for the app. Now Hindi language  candidates will be able to practice or give mock tests for these competitive exams in Hindi. Hindi version is a boon for students across India, as now, it has become even more accessible to students whose first language isn’t English. It is sure to be used now by several more students, to prepare for their entrance exams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Students who have already downloaded the app can start attempting mock tests in Hindi right away, or if they don’t have the app, it can be downloaded free of cost from the Google play store. The latest version of the app offers navigation, instructions, test taking and analysis in both languages, English and Hindi. Once the app is downloaded on their smartphone or tablet, students will need to sign up with their details, and then, they can choose Hindi as their language preference, and start giving mock tests for their selected examination in the Hindi language.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Similar to the experience in English language, every day, the NTA will release one new test in Hindi on the app, which students can download to attempt. They can attempt these tests offline, while their device is on ‘Airplane’ mode, and will need to go online once again, in order to submit the test and view their result. With a list of daily tests for exams including JEE Main, NEET and other exams to be added soon, students will be able to practice and attempt these tests from their homes, and can view their detailed test results immediately, along with a detailed analysis of their performance, all in their preferred language, whether Hindi or English.</p>
