These stickers will now have a green strip of 1 cm on top for BS VI, as mandated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The BS-VI emission standards, which have been mandated w.e.f. 1st April, 2020, provide for stricter and cleaner emission norms and are at par with the emission standards being followed across the world.  Such distinct  identification of vehicles for such emissions standard as is also being followed in other countries had been requested to the Government and brought-forth by the Government. </p>
