<p style="text-align:justify">A Vehicle Disinfectant Bay and a Foot-operated Height Adjustable Hands-Free Sanitizer Dispenser Stand are the two recently supported innovations under the campaign. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Vehicle Disinfectant Bay is a device to disinfect vehicles automatically, which reduces time and energy by completing the disinfection process of a vehicle in a very short time without much effort. It consists of a frame, tank, motor, MCB Board, agronet, nozzles, valves, pipes, and fittings and works on the principle of spraying disinfectant liquid by using an AC motor technology for operation. It can be deployed easily at State Border / Checkposts, which are the entry point of Vehicles in a State. It is already installed at two checkposts in the State of Sikkim &#8211; Rangpo Checkposts, East Sikkim, and Melli checkposts, South Sikkim.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The foot-operated Height Adjustable Hands-Free Sanitizer Dispenser Stand is an ideal ubiquitous hygiene solution for residential, commercial, and industrial applications wherein one simply needs to press with the foot a pedal, and the sanitizer will be dispensed. Its height is adjustable as per sanitizer bottle size, and it is steel epoxy powder coated. It also has non-skidding rubber shoes and has a special bottle holder made of high quality elastic. It can be deployed at malls, airports, theatres, banks, business parks, factories, educational institutions, bus depots or railway Stations, hotels, restaurants, and so on. It is being commercialized by Mumbai based Vissco Rehabilitation Aids Pvt. Ltd, a leading manufacturer of orthopedic products and mobility aids. </p>
