So far more than 3,00 samples have been tested for COVID-19. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">With testing capacity of 50 samples per day, CSIR-NEERI has the requisite infrastructure to test COVID-19 samples and take all appropriate bio-safety and bio-security precautions before testing. All the mandatory approvals required for testing of clinical samples were obtained to operationalise the testing facility, say Dr. Rakesh Kumar, director, CSIR-NEERI. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“The facility is open to testing COVID-19 samples from Nagpur and surrounding areas of Vidarbha. Apart from testing of clinical samples, the CSIR-NEERI is also supporting healthcare professionals by providing Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) to prevent them from contracting any infection while serving patients”, said Dr. Prakash Kumbhare, scientist at the CSIR-NEERI. </p>
