<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">♦ The Northern Limit of Monsoon (NLM) continues to pass through Kandla, Ahmedabad, Indore, Raisen, Khajuraho, Fatehpur and Bahraich.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">♦ A trough runs from central Pakistan to Manipur at lower tropospheric levels and a cyclonic circulation lies over Jharkhand &#038; neighbourhood at lower &#038; midtropospheric levels. Under the influence of these systems and its oscillation, widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall very likely to continue over east &#038; northeast India during next 5 days. Isolated extremely heavy is also likely over Sub-Himalayan West Bengal &#038; Sikkim and Meghalaya on today, the 18 June, 2020. Central India is also very likely to experience fairly widespread to widespread rainfall activity with isolated heavy to very heavy falls over East Madhya Pradesh &#038; Chhattisgarh during next 5 days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">♦ Light isolated to scattered rain/thunder shower very likely over northwest India except Uttrakhand (where, fairly widespread rainfall with isolated heavy falls is likely) during next 4-5 days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">♦ Due to likely dry northwesterly winds at lower tropospheric levels over most parts of Rajasthan, heat wave to severe heat wave conditions very likely over Rajasthan during next 2-3 days.</p>
