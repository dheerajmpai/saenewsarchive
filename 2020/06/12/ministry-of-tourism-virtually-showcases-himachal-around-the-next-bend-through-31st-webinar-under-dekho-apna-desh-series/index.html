Dekho Apna Desh Webinar Series is an effort to showcase India’s rich diversity under Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat programme. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The session of the Dekho Apna Desh webinar series on 11th June, 2020 was moderated by Rupinder Brar, Additional Director General, Ministry of Tourism.  The session was presented by Frank Schlichtmann, Founder, The 4tables Project, Ankit Sood, Managing Host, Sunshine Himalayan Adventures and Michael &#038; Devanshe Lidgley, Owners, Himalayan Orchard.   The three presenters virtualised and highlighted the unexplored destinations and unique cultural and heritage wealth of Himachal Pradesh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Mr. Frank Schlichtmann started the session by highlighting an interesting Art village Called Gunehar, beautiful amalgamation of nature, streams, forest. Gunehar is located in the Kangra district. The idea behind this Art project in Gunehar is to develop conscious effort among the travellers to put focus on the village without affecting the place with too much crowding.  Gunehar is well connected by road, rail and air.  The valley has many small villages and Gunehar is the largest panchayat with just 3000 people.  People are largely Gaddis with a few Bara Bhangalis.  The settlement started a little 100 years ago.  Originally people of the village are shepherds but now many of them are farmers, some have shops and some work.  Villagers are grounded, have sense of dignity and knowledgeable.  4 tables project started in the year 2008 with good participation, followed by Art festival in 2013.  Art shops were developed, inviting the artists to come and work in empty spaces and present their art work which is attended by people from all walks of life.  The whole event is a joint venture with the artist, visitors and villagers.  The villagers call it Mela.  It has become a huge success and final week is organised as art festival with theatre, music, film screening etc.  Local cultural elements are well represented towards the closing ceremony of the Art festival. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Mr.Ankit Sood took us virtually through the World Heritage Site Great Himalayan National Park located in the Kullu region.  Great Himalayan National Park is spread across four valleys-Sainj valley,  Jiwa Nal valley, Tirthan Valley and Parvati valley. The park protects over 1,000 plant species, including many medicinal herbs, 31 mammal species and 209 bird species, as well as amphibians, reptiles and insects. Four of GHNP’s mammal species and three of its bird species are globally threatened, including the musk deer and the western horned tragopan.</p>
