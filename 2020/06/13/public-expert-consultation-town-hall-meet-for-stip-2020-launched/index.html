<p style="text-align:justify">While inaugurating STIP 2020 Town Hall Meet, Prof K VijayRaghavan said that Covid 19 has shown us that it is critical to invest in science with missions focusing on critical areas like Change &#038; Sustainability, Environment &#038; Biodiversity and Information. “India is one of the few postcolonial countries that have invested in the development of Science and Technology,” he added.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He pointed out the necessity to make science and knowledge accessible freely for everybody across languages and other existing barriers. He said that the consequence of the policy should be to reach out to as many people as possible and for that translation of science is extremely important so that people can think independently in their own language and access knowledge and resources. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">At the inaugural session Prof Ashutosh Sharma mentioned that the new policy should bring about seamless connection of all stakeholders by identifying weak links in the chain and weakness in connection of silos and correcting them. He said the future is all about convergence &#038; integration of technologies. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">While giving a brief idea of the architecture of science policy and how this 2020 policy is special, he said that data, measurement wisdom, knowledge should come together for pole vaulting forward to bring change in science in several orders of magnitude. Prof Sharma said that the Atmanirbhar Bharat necessitated by the COVID19 should be globally competitive and this can be done only when the basic knowledge systems are connected. </p>
