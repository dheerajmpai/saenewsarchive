<p style="text-align:justify">Meteorological conditions leading to onset of southwest monsoon over Kerala </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">a) Widespread rainfall occurred over Kerala, during past 2 days. More than 70% of the 14 rainfall monitoring stations for Monsoon onset over Kerala have reported rainfall during last 48 hours (Fig-2). </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">b) Westerly winds have strengthened in the lower levels (wind speed upto 20 knots) and deepened upto 4.5 km over the south Arabian Sea.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">c) There is persistent convection (cloudiness indicated by Outgoing Longwave Radiation values <200 Wm-2) from satellite imagery and coastal Doppler Weather Radars from 27th May, 2020 onwards.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">d) In addition to the above features, a low pressure area has formed over Southeast &#038; adjoining Eastcentral Arabian Sea and Lakshadweep area on 31st May, 2020 which intensified into a depression over eastcentral &#038; adjoining southeast Arabian Sea today morning, the 1st June, 2020.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">e) Criterion for declaration of southwest monsoon over Kerala is given in Annexure 1.</p>
