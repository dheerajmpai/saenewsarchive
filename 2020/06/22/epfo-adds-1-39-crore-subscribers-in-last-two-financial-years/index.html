The payroll data, presents the consolidated annual figures for 2018-19 and 2019-20. Net addition to subscriber base rose from 61.12 lakh added in 2018-19 to 78.58 lakh in 2019-20, registering a 28% growth. The data published comprises of all the new members who have joined during the month and whose contribution is received.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The subscriber growth is on account of lower exits and higher rejoining by exited members. The tax free returns of 8.5% for 2019-20, which is one of the highest among other social security instruments and fixed deposits, has helped EPFO reduce its exits for 2019-20 by around 10% as compared with previous year. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Moreover, there has been a robust increase of around 75% in terms of rejoining by the members exited from 43.78 lakh in 2018-19 to 78.15 lakh in 2019-20. The auto-transfer facility which enables hassle free transfer of PF balance from the old account to the new account on change of job has played a big role in ensuring continuity of membership in many cases.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Age wise analysis during 2019-20 indicates that for the age group 26-28, 29-35 and beyond 35 the net enrolment has increased by more than 50% compared to previous year. Rapid improvement in quality of service delivery in online mode has attracted the workforce of the country towards services of EPFO. Moreover, PF accumulation is no longer looked at as locked-in money.

Similarly, PF advances can be availed in case of unemployment, marriage expense, higher education, housing and medical treatment.</p>
