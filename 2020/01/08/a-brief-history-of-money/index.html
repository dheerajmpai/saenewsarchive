<p>Money matters! But do we really wonder why, since when and in what form?</p>



<p>Going
back to basics, what exactly is money? Is it a giant cube of gold
measuring sixty-seven ft on a side or is it simply the steel coins or
paper cash? Where did the concept of money come from? Where does it
go? 
</p>



<p>Before
delving into the questions mentioned above, it is important to
understand that money has been subjected to several opinions over its
long history. From being referred to as the most important medium of
exchange and forming the bedrock of capitalism to becoming an
instrument of capitalist exploitation, as postulated by Karl Marx,
money as a concept and as an entity, has and continues to undergo
massive changes.   
</p>



<p>The
importance that money has created for itself, goes beyond any
political spectrum, so much so that no Communist state not even
Vietnam has found it to practical or optimum to dispense off money.</p>



<p><strong>What
is money?</strong></p>



<p>Money
is a medium of exchange, with an advantage of eliminating the
shortcomings of barter; a unit of account that facilitates valuation
and calculation and a store of value. To perform all these functions
efficiently, money had to be reliable, durable, portable, affordable
and most importantly available.</p>



<p>Since,
metals like gold, silver, and bronze fulfilled most of the criteria,
they were regarded as the ideal monetary raw materials for millennia.
However, using a variety of metals as monetary raw materials gave
rise to, what economists now call, the big problem of small change.
This refers to the difficulty in establishment of stable
relationships between different kinds of coin (deciding what is more
valuable &#8211; gold or silver), which also meant that smaller
denomination coins were subject to perennial shortages leading to
depreciation and debasement.</p>



<p><strong>But
when introduced, money was not declared an outright utopia as a
concept. There were challenges faced by the then kingdoms and
civilizations, mentioned as follows: </strong>
</p>



<p>First, the value of precious metal is not absolute. Money is worth what the transactor is willing to give for it. An increase in its supply will not make the society richer but enrich the government that monopolizes the production of money. Other factors and parameters remaining unchanged, monetary expansion will merely cause inflation.</p>



<p>Second,
money made of precious metals like gold &amp; silver was used to buy
jewelry (which is additionally fabricated from gold). Frequently, the
price of gold present in the coin(s) used to be more than the value
of jewelry itself. Thus, it was still feasible to melt the gold coins
and make jewelry than to buy it.</p>



<p><strong>A
probable solution that came to the fore was in the form of declaring
money as Promissory Notes which lied on the bedrock of Belief and
Trust.</strong></p>



<p>Just
take a look at any Reserve Bank of India note: ‘I promise to pay
the bearer the sum of…’. Banknotes or bills (originated in 7<sup>th</sup>
Century China) are pieces of paper which have nearly no intrinsic
worth. These are just promises to pay, as derived from their original
Western terminology of ‘promissory notes’. Thus, when an Indian
vegetable vendor is exchanging his vegetables for a fistful of
rupees, he is trusting the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India.</p>



<p>What
the early kingdoms and civilizations failed to understand is that
money is a matter of belief and trust &#8211; belief in the institution or
person issuing the money. The true value is in the trust, it
inscribes. It could be metal, paper or cryptocurrencies. Or else
anything, everything or ‘nothing’ can serve as money, from
sea-shells found at a beach in Goa to white marble plates mined in
Makrana.</p>



<p><strong>Where
does the money go and how does it become Savings, Assets or
Investments?</strong></p>



<p>
Whenever a
purchase or sale (of goods, services, assets) is made, a transaction
takes place. The total of those transactions conjures the economy. A
successful transaction has two elements- a buyer exchanging cash with
a seller for the products, services or assets. Money has no intrinsic
worth hence it’s one person’s spending which is another person’s
income. It is what economists call the economic machinery or economic
cycle.</p>



<p>The
balance money someone is left with, from a periodic income and their
spending becomes the savings. Since the future is unpredictable, it
is the basic impulse to save.</p>



<p>Once
these savings get accumulated, it can be invested in a wide range of
assets, becoming investments. Investment by definition is something
that is purchased with an expectation to produce income or profit.</p>



<p><strong>Money at the current juncture is in a very exciting phase. It is not only going digital but also crypto, constantly undergoing change in its form, content or entity. </strong> </p>
