Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Economic Survey 2019-20 in the Parliament today. The Key Highlights of the Economic Survey 2019-20 are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Wealth Creation: The Invisible Hand Supported by the Hand of Trust</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Entrepreneurship and Wealth Creation at the Grassroots</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o 12.2 % cumulative annual growth rate of new firms in the formal sector during 2014-18, compared to 3.8 % during 2006-2014.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o About 1.24 lakh new firms created in 2018, an increase of about 80 % from about 70,000 in 2014.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Impact is most pronounced when literacy is above 70 per cent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o New firm formation is the lowest in eastern India with lowest literacy rate (59.6 % as per 2011 Census).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Pro-business versus Pro-markets</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Promoting ‘pro-business’ policy that unleashes the power of competitive markets to generate wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Weaning away from ‘pro-crony’ policy that may favour specific private interests, especially powerful incumbents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Before liberalisation, a Sensex firm expected to stay in it for 60 years, which decreased to only 12 years after liberalisation. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Every five years, one-third of Sensex firms are churned out, reflecting the continuous influx of new firms, products and technologies into the economy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o An equity index of connected firms significantly outperformed market by 7 % a year from 2007 to 2010, reflecting abnormal profits extracted at common citizens’ expense. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o In contrast, the index underperforms market by 7.5 % from 2011, reflecting inefficiency and value destruction inherent in such firms.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Undermining Markets: When Government Intervention Hurts More Than It Helps</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Frequent and unpredictable imposition of blanket stock limits on commodities under ECA distorts:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">• The incentives for the creation of storage infrastructure by the private sector. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">• Movement up the agricultural value chain. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">• Development of national market for agricultural commodities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Imposition of stock limits on dal in 2006-Q3, sugar in 2009-Q1 and onions in September, 2019 spiked up the volatility of the retail and wholesale prices of onions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o The Ministry of Consumer Affairs must examine whether the ECA is relevant in today’s India. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o With raids having abysmally low conviction rate and no impact on prices, the ECA only seems to enable rent-seeking and harassment. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Survey suggests there is clear evidence for jettisoning this anachronistic legislation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o The regulation of prices of drugs, through the DPCO 2013, led to increase in the price of the regulated pharmaceutical drug vis-à-vis that of an unregulated but similar drug.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o The increase in prices is greater for more expensive formulations than for cheaper ones and for those sold in hospitals rather than retail shops. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o These findings reinforce that the outcome is opposite to what DPCO aims to do &#8211; making drugs affordable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Government, being a huge buyer of drugs, can intervene more effectively to provide affordable drugs by combining all its purchases and exercising its bargaining power. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Ministry of Health and Family Welfare must evolve non-distortionary mechanisms that utilise Government’s bargaining power in a transparent manner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Policies in the food-grain markets led to:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">• Emergence of Government as the largest procurer and hoarder of rice and wheat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">• Crowding out of private trade.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">• Burgeoning food subsidy burden</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">• Inefficiencies in the markets, affecting the long run growth of agricultural sector. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o The food-grains policy needs to be dynamic and allow switching from physical handling and distribution of food-grains to cash transfers/food coupons/smart cards.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Analysis of debt waivers given by States/Centre:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">• Full waiver beneficiaries consume less, save less, invest less and are less productive after the waiver, compared to the partial beneficiaries. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">• Debt waivers disrupt the credit culture. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">• They reduce formal credit flow to the very same farmers, thereby defeating the purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Government must systematically examine areas of needless intervention and undermining of markets; but it does not argue that there should be no Government intervention. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Instead it suggests that the interventions that were apt in a different economic setting may have lost their relevance in a transformed economy. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Eliminating such instances will enable competitive markets spurring investments and economic growth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Creating Jobs and Growth by Specializing in Network Products</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">o Create 4 crore well-paid jobs by 2025 and 8 crore by 2030.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Specialization at large scale in labour-intensive sectors, especially network products.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Laser-like focus on enabling assembling operations at mammoth scale in network products.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Export primarily to markets in rich countries.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Trade policy must be an enabler.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o India’s exports increased by 13.4 % for manufactured products and 10.9 % for total merchandise</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Imports increased by 12.7 % for manufactured products and 8.6 per cent for total merchandise. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o India gained 0.7 % increase in trade surplus per year for manufactured products and 2.3 % per year for total merchandise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Targeting Ease of Doing Business in India</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o For merchandise exports, the logistics process flow for imports is more efficient than that for exports.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Electronics exports and imports through Bengaluru airport illustrate how Indian logistical processes can be world class.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Close coordination between the Logistics division of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs, Ministry of Shipping and the different port authorities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Individual sectors such as tourism or manufacturing require a more targeted approach that maps out the regulatory and process bottlenecks for each segment.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o PSBs are inefficient compared to their peer groups on every performance parameter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o In 2019, investment for every rupee in PSBs, on average, led to the loss of 23 paise, while in NPBs it led to the gain of 9.6 paise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Credit growth in PSBs has been much lower than NPBs for the last several years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">· Solutions to make PSBs more efficient:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) for PSBs’ employees</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Representation on boards proportionate to the blocks held by employees to incentivize employees and align their interests with that of all shareholders of banks.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Creation of a GSTN type entity that will aggregate data from all PSBs and use technologies like big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning in credit decisions for ensuring better screening and monitoring of borrowers, especially the large ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Financial Fragility in the NBFC Sector</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Asset Liability Management (ALM) Risk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Interconnectedness Risk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Financial and Operating Resilience of an NBFC.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Over-dependence on short-term wholesale funding.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o  The HFC sector exhibited a declining trend post 2014 and overall health of the sector worsened considerably by the end of FY2019.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o The Score of the Retail-NBFC sector was consistently below par for the period 2014 -19.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Larger Retail-NBFCs had higher Health Scores but among medium and small Retail- NBFCs, the medium size ones had a lower score for the entire period of 2014-19.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Privatization and Wealth Creation</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Financial indicators such as net worth, net profit, return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE) etc of the privatized CPSEs, on an average, have improved significantly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Privatized CPSEs have been able to generate more wealth from the same resources.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Bring in higher profitability.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Promote efficiency.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Increase competitiveness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">o Promote professionalism.</p>
