As a proportion of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the expenditure on social services has registered an increase of 1.5 percentage points during the period 2014-15 to 2019-20 from 6.2 to 7.7 per cent.

<p style="text-align:justify">Human Development</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India&#8217;s rank in the Human Development Index (HDI) improved to 129 in 2018 from 130 in 2017, reaching a value of 0.647. With 1.34 per cent average annual HDI growth, India is among the fastest improving countries. Among its BRICS peers, India is ahead of China (0.95), South Africa (0.78), Russian Federation (0.69) and Brazil (0.59). To sustain this momentum in human development and to further accelerate it, the role of public sector in delivery of social services is critical, observes the Survey.</p>
