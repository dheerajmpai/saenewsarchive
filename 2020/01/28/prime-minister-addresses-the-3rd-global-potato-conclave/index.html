<p style="text-align:justify">Addressing the Conclave, the Prime Minister said that the highlight of the 3rd  conclave is that Potato Conference, AgriExpo and Potato Field Day are all happening at the same time.

<p style="text-align:justify">The Prime Minister said that it is significant that the 3rd Global Potato Conclave is being held in Gujarat, the leading state in Potato production and productivity in the country. He said that while the area under potato cultivation increased by about 20% in India in the last eleven years, it has increased by about 170% in Gujarat during the same period.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Prime Minister said that this is largely owing to the policy initiatives and decisions which lead to the State using modern methods of agriculture like sprinkler and drip irrigation for cultivation, along with the best cold storage facilities and linkages to the Food Processing Industry. He said today Gujarat has major Potato processing companies in the state and that most of the potato exporters are also based in Gujarat. These have led to the emergence of the state as a major potato hub in the country.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Prime Minister said that his Government is taking rapid steps towards the goal of doubling the income of farmers by 2022. He added that as a result of the efforts of farmers and the combination of government policy, India is among the top 3 countries in the world in the production of many cereals and other food items. He also listed the steps taken by his Government to promote food processing industries at every level like opening the sector to 100% FDI, helping in value addition and value chain development through PM Kisan Sampada Yojana.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Prime Minister also mentioned that earlier this month, a new record has also been created by transferring an amount of Rs. 12,000 crores to the bank accounts of 6 crore farmers through direct transfer. He also mentioned that the priority of his Government is to reduce middlemen and other layers between the farmer and the consumer. He said that the government&#8217;s emphasis is also on promoting agricultural technology-based start ups so that farmers&#8217; databases and agri stacks needed for smart and precision agriculture can be used.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Prime Minister urged the scientists to provide solutions to various issues in Agriculture through modern biotechnology, Artificial Intelligence, Block chain, Drone Technology. He said that the greatest responsibility of the scientific community and policy makers is to see that no one is left hungry or malnourished.</p>
