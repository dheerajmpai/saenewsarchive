Since independence, independent India has promised Hindus-Sikhs and other minorities in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan that they can come to India if they need to. He promised that India stands with them. He added that this was also the wish of Gandhiji, this was also the spirit of the Nehru-Liaquat agreement in 1950. “In these countries, people who were tortured because of their faith, it is the responsibility of India to give them asylum, give them citizenship of India. But thousands of such people were turned away.”, the PM said. “In order to stop the historical injustice done to such people, today our government has brought Citizenship Amendment Act, giving citizenship of India to such people to fulfill the old promise of India” the PM said.</p>

This was achieved by constructing Kartarpur corridor by this Government.</p>
