<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As a part of Nationally Determined Contributions as per the Paris Accord on Climate Change, India has made a pledge that by 2030, 40% of our installed power generation capacity shall be from non-fossil fuel sources and also by 2030, reduce emission intensity of GDP by 33-35 % from 2005 level. Economic growth, increasing prosperity, a growing rate of urbanisation and rising per capita energy consumption has increased the energy demand of the country.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Keeping in view the above and our commitment for a healthy planet with less carbon intensive economy, we decided in 2015 that 175 GW of renewable energy capacity will be installed by the year 2022. This includes 100 GW from solar, 60 GW from wind, 10 GW from biomass and 5 GW from small hydro power.The substantial higher capacity target will ensure greater energy security, improved energy access and enhanced employment opportunities. With the accomplishment of these ambitious targets, India will become one of the largest Green Energy producers in the world, even surpassing several developed countries.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Prime Minister in his address atto Climate Action Summit stated that “India’s renewable energy capacity would be increased to much beyond 175 GW, and later till 450 GW”.In line with the objective of expanding renewable energy sector, several important initiatives were taken during year 2019.</p>
