<p style="text-align:justify">The Nature India essay competition is open for readers aged 25 to 50.

The essays should convey thoughts on the societal impact of science in India in not more than 1000 words. The tone of the essays must be aspirational, with emotions and story-telling. The essays should be reasoned, well-researched, forward-looking and supported by existing science. </p>
