<p style="text-align:justify">The International Day of Yoga has been celebrated annually on 21 June since 2015. The idea of International Day of Yoga was first proposed by the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi, during his address at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), on 27 September 2014.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">While proposing the idea the Prime Minister stated: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“Yoga is an invaluable gift of India&#8217;s ancient tradition. It embodies unity of mind and body; thought and action; restraint and fulfillment; harmony between man and nature; a holistic approach to health and well-being. It is not about exercise but to discover the sense of oneness with yourself, the world and the nature. By changing our lifestyle and creating consciousness, it can help in well being. Let us work towards adopting an International Yoga Day.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Following this initial proposal, the UNGA held informal consultations on the draft resolution, entitled &#8220;International Day of Yoga&#8221;, on 14 October 2014. The consultations were convened by the delegation of India.On 11 December 2014, India&#8217;s Permanent Representative introduced the draft resolution in the United Nations General Assembly. The draft text received broad support from 177 Member States who sponsored the text, which was adopted without a vote. This initiative found support from most global leaders. A total of 177 nations co-sponsored the resolution, which is the highest number of co-sponsors ever for any UNGA resolution of such nature.</p>
