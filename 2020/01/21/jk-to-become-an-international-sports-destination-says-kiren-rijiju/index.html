<p style="text-align:justify">Emphasising that Article 370 was the real impediment towards the development of the erstwhile state, the Minister said that the youth of J&#038;K have been deprived of sports opportunities in the past or otherwise the Union Territory of J&#038;K would have been a great destination for sports.The minister said that participation in every sport would have been more from J&#038;K if the sports infrastructure had been improved in the past. He said, “the day has come when all the pending approvals related to sports or infrastructure will be cleared by the central government and a new sunrise in the development will be shown to the UT of J&#038;K”.</p>
