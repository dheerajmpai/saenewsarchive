<p style="text-align:justify">Dr. R. Chidambaram, Former Principal Scientific Adviser to GoI, Former Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and Secretary, Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) said that India, of our dream is India which is economically developed and scientifically advanced and our country is moving in that direction. He said that we need to build an excellent research, development and innovative eco-system, which provides our scientists and engineers an opportunity to excel in basic research, applied research, technology development and R&#038;D-led innovation. We want to build advanced super structures, but advanced Mega Science and Mega Technology research and development projects can no longer be taken by a single country, he said. He further emphasized that international cooperation is needed and India is participating in such projects today as an equal partner. Such successful stories must be communicated to the young audience and Vigyan Samagam is exactly doing the same, Dr Chidambaram said. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Congratulating the joint organizers of Vigyan Samagam for organizing this Exhibition. Dr Paul Ho, a world &#8211; renowned Astrophysicist and Director General of East Asian Observatory shared his experience about the first image of a supermassive black hole, &#8220;The Event Horizon Telescope, a network of 8 radio telescopes, operating at millimeter-wavelengths, and spanning the surface of the earth, has successfully produced the first picture of a black hole. We achieved the highest angular resolution in astronomy by using the Very Long Baseline Interferometry. This Supermassive Black Hole, in the nucleus of the M87 galaxy, is the first case where we can resolve the event horizon, where even light itself cannot escape from the gravity of the black hole.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri K. N. Vyas, Chairman, AEC and Secretary, DAE, said that it has been an exciting time during the entire journey of Vigyan Samagam and we are extremely proud to have the final edition in New Delhi.
