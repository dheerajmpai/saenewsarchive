The Island Development Agency reviewed the progress made towards the programme “Holistic development of islands”. For the first time in the country, under the guidance of IDA, an initiative of sustainable development in the identified Islands within scientifically-assessed carrying capacity has been taken-up. Development Plans with focus on creation of jobs for the islanders through tourism promotion as well as export of seafood and coconut-based products made in the Islands have been prepared and are being implemented in four islands of Andaman &#038; Nicobar and five islands of Lakshadweep. In the second phase, suitable sites in 12 more islands of Andaman &#038; Nicobar Islands and 5 islands in Lakshadweep have been covered. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Model tourism projects both Land-based and Water Villas were planned and bids have been invited for private sector participation.As a unique initiative, to spur investment, it was decided to obtain clearances for implementation of the planned projects up-front. All necessary clearances would be in place before bids finalization. Environment and Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) clearances have already been obtained for four exemplary tourism projects of Andaman &#038; Nicobar Islands. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">For strengthening infrastructure support, projects for improving air, sea and digital connectivity are also being implemented. Port Blair and another 7 islands in Andaman &#038; Nicobar would get digitally connected through submarine optical fibre cable by June, 2020. Better communication services would facilitate setting up of Information Technology based and other Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in the islands with incentives through Lakshadweep and Andaman &#038; Nicobar Islands Industrial Development Scheme (LANIDS), 2018 notified on 1st January, 2019. The proposed airports in Great Nicobar Island of Andaman &#038; Nicobar and Minicoy Island of Lakshadweep would catalyze the development process in the region. </p>
