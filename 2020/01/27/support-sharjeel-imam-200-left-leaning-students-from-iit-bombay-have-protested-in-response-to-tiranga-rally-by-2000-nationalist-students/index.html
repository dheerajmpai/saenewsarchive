<h2>Background</h2>



<p>In the wake of anti-CAA protests on the campus by a &#8216;left-leaning students group&#8217;, a &#8216;Tirange Rally&#8217; was organized on the campus on the evening before the repulic day where the apart from nationalistic fervour, the main demand was to keep the campus free of political movements. The rally recevied a massive supprt from the campus community where more than 2000 students, professors and staffs  marched for 4.5km with the 1000ft long national flag.</p>

<p> In response to the apolitical tiranga rally, the &#8216;left-leaning students group&#8217; has been working on &#8216;Reclaim Republic Rally&#8217; protests. This group has a Facebook page named &#8216;IIT Bombay for Justice&#8217;. Like many incendiary messages they have exhibited over the last few weeks in the protests, one of the placard in the <strong>&#8216;Reclaim Republic Rally&#8217;</strong> says <strong>&#8216;Support Sharjeel Imam&#8217;!</strong></p>

<h2>  Varun Grover &amp; Samata Kala Mach</h2>



<p>On the evening of 26th January, the left-leaning group had invited Varun Grover, a known comedian who has been giving anti-CAA comments and a group called &#8216;Samata Kala Mach&#8217; who has been organizing Shaheen Baag like protests in Mumbai. However, to the best of students&#8217; knowledge none of these events have been official and there is no official persmission taken for those. Knowing this a few students on the campus personally approached the director of IITB and chief security officer to inform about the unofficial event during the day. </p>



<p>The &#8216;Samata Kala Manch&#8217; group reached the campus gate in the evening but were not allowed to enter inside the campus based on the students&#8217; prior complaint. Varun Grover, however, entered inside by as a friend of another student from the anti-CAA group. After entering the campus, Varun Grover did take part in the protests, but was duly confronted by IITB security, students and Mumbai Police, who were called by a few vigilant students who saw that the &#8216;left-leaning student group&#8217; was not paying heed to the institute authorities. Varun Grover was ultimately asked to leave the premises, but he continued his presence even after securities warning. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Bharat mata is not our mother&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>In another event, when the flag dehoisting ceremony was happening in the evening, the students from the &#8216;Tiranga Rally&#8217; were chanting slogans like bharat mata ki jai. This is when the &#8216;left-leaning student group&#8217; intervened and said that you can not chant that, you can not call the country mother. This naturally sparked a confrontation betweek the two groups. </p>



<p>All this comes in the wake of repeated requests by the student community on the campus that the persistant, chaotic protests by the &#8216;left-leaning student group&#8217; have hampered academic work of the students. Furthremore, in the recent open-house discussion, the institute director has sternly dissuaded such political protests on the cammpus.</p>



<p>Moreover, the severity of the issue can be gauged by the fact that the facebook page of the organizers of the anti CAA rally called &#8220;IIT B for Justice&#8221; clearly shows they made posters in support of Sharjeel Imam who has been arrested for inciting national disintegration.</p>
