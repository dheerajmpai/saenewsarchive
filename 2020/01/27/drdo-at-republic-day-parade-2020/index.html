Continuous innovation in advanced defence technology has led to many pathbreaking systems being realised in the country. This year’s Republic Day parade at Rajpath today saw many defence systems developed by DRDO as part of the contingents of the Armed Forces and DRDO. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The DRDO-developed products such as surface-to-air-missile ‘Akash’, Mobile Bridging System ‘Sarvatra’, beyond visual range air-to-air missile ‘Astra’, Light Combat Aircraft ‘Tejas’, Air Defence Tactical Control Radar (ADTCR) and Anti-Satellite Missile (ASAT) were displayed as part of different tableaux of DRDO and the Armed Forces. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The DRDO showcased the ASAT missile used in Mission Shakti. Maiden successful trial of ASAT was carried out on March 27, 2019. Mission Shakti, the test mission, was a major breakthrough in demonstrating the nation’s anti-satellite technology and precision strike capability. ASAT will play a critical role in providing necessary deterrence against rogue satellites as well as intercontinental ballistic missiles. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The ADTCR, the other presentation from DRDO, is used for volumetric surveillance, detection, tracking and friend/foe identification of aerial targets of different types. The radar is capable of detecting very small targets and low flying targets.</p>
