<p style="text-align:justify">Union Minister of State for Finance &#038; Corporate Affairs, Shri Anurag Singh Thakur has expressed confidence that with concerted efforts of the Central Board of Indirect Taxes &#038; Customs (CBIC), India would further improve its position in ranking for Ease of Doing Business. While addressing at Investiture Ceremony &#038; International Customs Day 2020 here today, Shri Thakur said that India has risen in the Ease of Doing Business Rankings by being transparent, accountable and logical. This rise in rankings is due to the efforts of the officers of CBIC as Trading Across Borders is one of the key parameter of the rankings and it is credit to the efforts of CBIC that this key parameter has performed. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">While stressing on harnessing technology for faster resolution, the Minister said that technology plays an important role by ensuring efficiency, transparency and accountability.
