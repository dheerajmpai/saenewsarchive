But we can do a lot more together.  There is huge untapped potential both on the trade and investment sides. Indian companies are active in Brazil in IT, automobiles and energy sectors.  We are keen to leverage defence and food processing expertise of Brazil to boost our Make in India initiatives. We invite Brazilian companies to partner us in our economic programmes. Sectors such as renewable energy, biotechnology and animal husbandry also present huge opportunities for our companies.  </p>

Our shared perspectives have brought us together as Strategic Partners. We are committed to build an international order that is reflective of new global realities; we are committed to strengthen multilateralism for global peace and stability; and we are committed to fight terrorism for a secure and safe world for our peoples. From BRICS to bilateral platforms, we have a forward looking agenda. Even as we address the inequities of the past, we must craft a sustainable world for our future generations.</p>
