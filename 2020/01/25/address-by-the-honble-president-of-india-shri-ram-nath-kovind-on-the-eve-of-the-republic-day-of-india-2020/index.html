<p style="text-align:justify">Dear fellow citizens,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">To effectively meet the challenge of the increasing water crisis, the Ministry of Jalshakti has been created. Water conservation and water management are being given top priority. I am confident that, like ‘Swachchh Bharat Abhiyan’, ‘Jal Jeevan Mission’ too will take the form of a popular movement. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dear fellow citizens,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dear fellow citizens, </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Fellow Citizens,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">When fighting for a cause, people, particularly the youth, should not forget the gift of Ahimsa Gandhiji gave to humanity. Gandhiji’s talisman for deciding whether an act is right or wrong also applies to the functioning of our democracy. Government and opposition both have important roles to play. While giving expression to their political ideas, both must move forward in tandem to ensure that development of the country and welfare of its people are promoted consistently.  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dear fellow citizens,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“If we wish to maintain democracy not merely in form, but also in fact, what must we do? The first thing in my judgment we must do is to hold fast to constitutional methods of achieving our social and economic objectives.” </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">These words have always lighted our path. These words will continue to show us the way ahead to new glories. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dear citizens,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">We have a tradition of inviting foreign heads of states to participate in our Republic Day celebrations. I am glad that this year, our distinguished friend, The President of Brazil, Mr. Jair Bolsonaro will take part in our Republic Day function tomorrow. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As India and Indians march forward, we remain committed to engaging the global community to build a secure and prosperous future for ourselves and for the entire humanity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Jai Hind!</p>
