<p style="text-align:justify">President was received at Kavaratti by Administrator of Lakshadweep Shri Dineshwar Sharma along with others. He was accorded a Guard of Honour and received a traditional welcome at Karavatti.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The President later attended a public reception where he laid the foundation stone of a super specialty hospital.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">While addressing the audience the President said that this a special place, blessed with unparalleled natural beauty. However, the clear blue waters of Lakshadweep reflect not just the magic of nature. It also testifies to the wisdom of all of the people of these islands, and their love and concern for environment. Lakshadweep presents itself as a mesmerizing eco-system made up of its under-water life, pristine lagoons, coral reefs, warm waters and its people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He said that I am aware that living here comes with some unique challenges, such as maintaining connectivity with the mainland and among islands, and harsh weather conditions particularly during monsoons. Nothing though has prevented Lakshadweepâ€™s onward march and progress.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The President said that he was happy to lay the foundation stone of the super-specialty Hospital here at Kavaratti. He said that the hospital will address many of the health related issues of people living here in Kavaratti as well as those living in other islands. More importantly, when this hospital comes up and becomes fully functional, it would significantly reduce the need for patients to go to Kochi for treatment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The President said that there are issues that confront people of Lakshadweep. For instance, all islands in Lakshadweep are totally dependent for electricity on diesel generators. He said that we need to explore ways to reduce the dependence on diesel generated power. We should look to expand the use of renewable energy in Lakshadweep, given that both wind and sun are available here in abundance. I also understand that Lakshadweep has scarcity of potable water. This is another area where innovative solutions need to be found and adopted. I am sure that people of Lakshadweep and the authorities concerned will work together to address all such issues.</p>
