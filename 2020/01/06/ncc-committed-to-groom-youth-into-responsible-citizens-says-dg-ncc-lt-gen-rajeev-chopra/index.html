Addressing the annual press conference during the NCC Republic Day Camp (RDC) here today, the DG NCC highlighted the major role of NCC in empowering the youth in nation building, creating social awareness, community development, environment protection, sports and adventure among them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Lt Gen Chopra said, the training philosophy of the NCC cadets has been refined to accommodate the changing aspirations of the youth and expectations of the society. “The focus is now on personality development, leadership traits and improving soft skills of the cadets, so as to equip them for future challenges,” he added. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The DG NCC highlighted that Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) have been signed with 10 countries for Youth Exchange Programme (YEP). However, to give the cadets a wider exposure, YEP with seven more countries is in an advanced stage of approval, he said.</p>
