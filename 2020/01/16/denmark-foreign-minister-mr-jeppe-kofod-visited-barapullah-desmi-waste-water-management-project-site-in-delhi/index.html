<p style="text-align:justify">The Barapullah drain is one of the main water transport ways in New Delhi that collects water from various smaller water drains from all over the city. It is mainly used for waste water and sewage transport. Because of the high population density, water scarcity and size of the waste water flow, the Barapullah drain is an excellent location for research in the area of waste water management.</p>
