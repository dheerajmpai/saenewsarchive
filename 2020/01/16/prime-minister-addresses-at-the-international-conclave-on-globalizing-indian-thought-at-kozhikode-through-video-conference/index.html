<p style="text-align:justify">He was participating in the international conclave on “Global Indian Thought” that is being organised by IIM Kozhikode.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Addressing the gathering the Prime Minister said, “Indian thought is vibrant and diverse.  It is constant and evolving. It is too vast to be put in a lecture or a seminar or even books. But, broadly, there are certain ideals that have remained central to Indian values. They are- compassion, harmony, justice, service and openness”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Peace, Harmony &#038; Brotherhood</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Referring to what draws the world to India, the Prime Minister said, “First and foremost, what comes to the mind is- the virtues of peace, unity and brotherhood. “</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He said because of harmony and peace our civilization prospered and survived where many have failed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“So many states. So many languages. So many dialects. So many faiths. So many customs and traditions. So many food habits. So many lifestyles. So many ways of dressing. Yet, for centuries we have lived in peace. For centuries we have welcomed the world to our land. Our civilization has prospered when many could not. Why? Because one finds peace and harmony here.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He said our strengths is that our thoughts have become living traditions guided by simplified and relatable practices. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“These practices are neither rigid nor unidimensional. Their beauty lies in the fact that they can be practiced differently,” he said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He said India is land that gave vibrant faiths such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“In this land the Sufism flourished”, he said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Saying that Non-Violence is at the core of all these, he said Mahatma Gandhi “championed these ideals” that led to India’s freedom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“The Indian way of conflict avoidance is not by brute force but the power of dialogue,” he said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Love for Environment:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“When I say India believes in peace and harmony, this includes harmony with Mother Nature and our environment, “he said. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Prime said the traces of this spirit can be seen in several steps being taken now.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He said India led the world in forming the “International Solar Alliance, to harness solar energy for a cleaner tomorrow.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Prime Minister said in the last 5 years 36 Crore LED  bulbs were distributed and over 1 Crore Street lights replaced with LED making a saving of Rs 25000 Crore and reducing CO2 emissions by 4 Crore Tonnes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Protecting the Tiger and the Lion</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He said India’s tiger population doubled since 2006. “Today, India is home to almost 2970 tigers. Three quarters of the world’s tiger population stays in India.
