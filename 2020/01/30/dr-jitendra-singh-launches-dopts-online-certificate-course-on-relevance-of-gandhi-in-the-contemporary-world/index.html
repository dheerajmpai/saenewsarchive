The online course/programme on Mahatma Gandhi is an initiative of the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) under the iGOTprogramme to pay tribute to Father of the Nation coinciding with the Martyr’s Day today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Addressing the gathering, DrJitendra Singh said the Mahatma’s teachings are more relevant today than ever before. “Gandhijicreated a mass awareness for people’s participation and the freedom movement. Even today, the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), inspired by Bapu, has turned into a mass campaign because of translating Gandhian thought into action. As far as adopting Gandhiji’s thoughts in Government functioning is concerned, Bapu stressed upon the concept of incorruptibility,” he said. “It is not enough to weed out corruption, but it must be eliminated. Like the resort to non-violence is not an ideal of the meek and weak, but of the strong and powerful, similarly the principle of incorruptibility can be adapted to the administration,” he added.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The online module/course on “Relevance of Gandhi in the Contemporary World” under the iGOT platform will be a certificate programme.  This Department has collaborated with the Centre for Gandhi and Peace Studies, Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) and Gandhi Smriti and DarshanSamiti (GS &#038; DS), to develop this Certificate Programme. </p>
