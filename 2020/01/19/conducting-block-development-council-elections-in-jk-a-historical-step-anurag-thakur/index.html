<p style="text-align:justify">While addressing a large gathering, Shri Thakur said that the BDC elections in J&#038;K was a historical step that made the local self government a part of the decision making authority of which they have been deprived of from the last seventy two years. He further said that the govt. wants grass root level participation to become an integral part of democracy which can then empower people socially, economically and politically. He also urged the Block Development Council members to implement the basic centrally sponsored schemes up to the gross root level to which they have been deprived of from many decades. </p>

He reiterated that the Prime Minister of India has taken the UT of J&#038;K on top priority in terms of development. Giving details regarding centrally sponsored schemes, the Minister said that the UT of J&#038;K stood first in the implementation of Ayushman Bharat Scheme, 18534 houses have been constructed under PMAY, 2.5 lac toilets were constructed under Swach Bharat and Ujjwala has reached to its hundred percent target in Jammu and Kashmir. He also urged the concerned authorities to speed up the execution of these centrally sponsored schemes for the benefit of the grass root level population and also emphasised to spread awareness about the various schemes of the Govt. like PM Jan Dhan Yojna, MGNREGA, PM Gram Sadak Yojna, PM Awas Yojna, National Health Mission, Ladli Beti, Old Age Pension and others.</p>

Talking about the sports talent in J&#038;K, the Minister said that sports infrastructure in J&#038;K will be upgraded as there is a huge potential among the youngsters and they were being held back in the past from achieving their dreams and glory by the lack of facilities. </p>
