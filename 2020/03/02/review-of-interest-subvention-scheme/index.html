In the modified guidelines, requirement of Udyog Aadhar Number (UAN) has been dispensed with for units registered for Goods and Service Tax (GST). However, in the case of units which are not registered under GSTN, may either submit Income Tax Permanent Account Number (PAN) or their loan account should be categorised as MSME by the concerned bank. </p>
