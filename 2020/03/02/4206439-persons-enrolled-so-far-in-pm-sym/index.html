This Act stipulates formulation of suitable welfare schemes for unorganised workers on matters relating to: (i) life and disability cover, (ii) health and maternity benefits, (iii) old age protection and (iv) any other benefit as may be determined by the Central Government. Life and disability cover is provided through Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) to the unorganised workers depending upon their eligibility. Ministry of Labour and Employment has been implementing the Converged Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha BimaYojana (PMSBY), since June 2017 to provide life and disability coverage to the unorganised workers depending upon their eligibility. Converged PMJJBY gives coverage of Rs.2 lakhs on death at premium of Rs.330/- per annum for an age span from 18 to 50 years.  Converged PMSBY gives coverage of Rs.2 lakhs on accidental death and disability at premium of Rs.12 per annum covering an age span from 18 years to 70 years. These converged schemes are being implemented by Life Insurance Corporation of India. The annual premium is shared on 50:50 basis by the Central Government and the State Governments. The new enrolment shall only be done under converged PMJJBY/PMSBY.  The number of beneficiaries enrolled under this Scheme, are as follows:</p>
