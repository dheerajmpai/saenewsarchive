Â Black carbon concentration in the region increases by 400 times during summer, according to a study. The study suggests agricultural burning and forest fire as the reason behind this seasonal increase. This can trigger glacial melt because of the light-absorbing nature of black carbon. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Scientists from Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, (WIHG), an autonomous institution under Department of Science &#038; Technology, in a study conducted at Chirbasa station near Gangotri Glacier, for the Year 2016, found that black carbon (BC) concentration in this region has changed drastically during summer. </p>
