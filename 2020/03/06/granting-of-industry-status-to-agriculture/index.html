<p style="text-align:justify">Government has been receiving suggestions from various quarters to accord industry status to the agriculture sector. However, the Government seeks to bestow on the agriculture sector as many benefits as available to those in the manufacturing sector, such as, easy availability of credit and other inputs and infrastructure facilities for development of agriculture sector including marketing and post harvest management. </p>
