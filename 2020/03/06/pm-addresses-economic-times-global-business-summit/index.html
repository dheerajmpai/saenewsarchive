<p style="text-align:justify">The Prime Minister said there was a time when things used to run according to the predictions of a particular class and their opinion was considered to be the final.

<p style="text-align:justify">The Prime Minister said the path in front of us was to walk on the same path as has been going on before, or to make our own path. We created a new route, moved ahead with a new approach and gave the highest priority to people&#8217;s aspirations, he added.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Modi emphasized that there is no harm in saying the right thing. But a class is hated, irritated by those who follow Doing the Right Things. So when there is a change in the Status Quo, such people start to see some kind of disruptions, he added.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Referring to the quote in RamcharitManas “It&#8217;s easier to preach than really act”, the Prime Minister said nation building, development of the country, governance are conviction and not convenience. “Conviction To Do The Right Thing, Conviction To Break The Status Quo,” he added.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The Prime Minister said that the 21st century itself is full of many possibilities. “Amidst these possibilities, there is a lack of a Common Global Voice today.

<p style="text-align:justify">The Prime Minister said that in the midst of changing global conditions, India has also made very wide changes. There was a period when India was neutral by creating equal distance between countries. Even today India is neutral, but by equal friendship, he added. “Keeping distance in that period, an attempt was made to escape. Today, we are trying to keep friendship and walk together. This is the very essence of India&#8217;s foreign policy, today&#8217;s economic policy of India,” he added.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Prime Minister concluded with the quote of Mahatma Gandhi ji &#8220;I want the rise of India so that the whole world can benefit from it&#8221; and said that this quote has the Indian thinking of Globalisation and the mantra of collaboration for the future.</p>
