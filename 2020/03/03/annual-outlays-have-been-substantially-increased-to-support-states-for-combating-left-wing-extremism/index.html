Kishan Reddy, in a written reply to a question regarding expenditure on Naxalite Eradication Campaign, in Lok Sabha today, said that as per Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India, subjects of Police and Public Order are with the State Governments. However, the Government of India (GoI) has been supplementing the efforts of States to address left wing extremism. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The annual outlays have been substantially increased to support States for combating left wing extremism. An amount of Rs. 848 crore was released by MHA to all the LWE affected States under such schemes during 2014-15 to 2016-17, whereas Rs. 3414.50 crore have been released/allocated during last three years between 2017-18 &#038; 2019-20.

<p style="text-align:justify">The Minister informed that as per the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, the State share in the net proceeds of Union taxes was raised from 32% to 42%.
