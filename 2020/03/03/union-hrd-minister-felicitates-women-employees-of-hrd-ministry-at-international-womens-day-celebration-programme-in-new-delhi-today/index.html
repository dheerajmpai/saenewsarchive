The HRD Minister has said that the Government has taken several game changing initiatives since 2014 for the education of the girl child. This is one of the reasons for the success of the scheme of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao whereby the Gross Enrolment Ratio of girls across all levels of education is now higher than boys. He hoped that the girls/women will outshine boys in all fields.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">While addressing the gathering Shri Dhotre said that the society which has treated its women well, has prospered. When women&#8217;s potential is unleashed, it benefits the society immensely. It is a mother who touches everyone&#8217;s life most deeply and becomes one&#8217;s first and foremost teacher. In this modern world there is not a single sphere untouched by women. And in our country, women have excelled in different sectors and have contributed so much in driving our country forward.</p>
