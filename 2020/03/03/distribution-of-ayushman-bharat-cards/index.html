<p style="text-align:justify">Ayushman Bharat &#8211; Pradhan Mantri Jan ArogyaYojana (AB-PMJAY) is an entitlement-based scheme for providing health cover up to Rs. 5 lakh per family per annum to around 10.74 crore poor and vulnerable families. No registration or enrolment of entitled beneficiaries is required for availing the benefits under AB-PMJAY.  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">However, in order to create awareness and facilitate easy availing of benefits, paper-based e-cards are being issued to the beneficiaries, after verifying their identity. The identification of beneficiaries is a continuous process and the responsibility of issuing AB-PMJAY e-cards lies with the States/UTs. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In Madhya Pradesh, around 83.92 lakh beneficiary families are entitled for benefits under AB-PMJAY and as on 02.03.2020, 1,40,63,887 individual beneficiaries have been verified under the scheme.  State has been advised to issue e-cards to eligible beneficiaries in a mission mode.</p>
