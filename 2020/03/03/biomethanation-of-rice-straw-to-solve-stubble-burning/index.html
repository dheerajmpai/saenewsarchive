<p style="text-align:justify">1. In an all India coordinated project, efforts are on to produce bio-gas for kitchen use and quality manure for fields using bio-methanation of rice straw by anaerobic digestion method. Six domestic level paddy straw based bio-gas plants have been installed in Punjab for field trials and further study is in progress.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">2. R&#038;D project has been supported on refinement and demonstration of an integrated process technology for conversion of crop residues into ethanol and methane for use as transport fuels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">3. A major focus on agriculture waste/stubble management (waste to wealth), alternative to burning, has been taken up under waste management technologies programme and proposals are being considered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This was stated by Minister of Science and Technology, Health and Family Welfare, and Earth Sciences, Dr. Harsh Vardhan in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today.</p>
