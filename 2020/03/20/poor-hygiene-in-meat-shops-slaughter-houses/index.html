Fish/Meat Markets and Slaughter houses in the country are controlled by local bodies and State Governments. However, some States have informed that, there are few markets where poor hygienic conditions prevail. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Guidelines for slaughter houses in the country have been prescribed under regulation 2.1.2(1) (5), Schedule 4, Part IV of the Food Safety and Standard (Licensing and Registration) Regulations, 2011. The guidelines cover specific hygienic and sanitary practices to be followed by Food Business Operators engaged in manufacture, processing, storing and selling of meat and meat products. State /UT Governments also have their own guidelines for slaughter houses and slaughtering of animals. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">FSSAI has launched ‘Clean and Safe Meat Campaign’ wherein, in the first phase, States/UTs were advised to conduct food safety audit of their municipal slaughter houses through FSSAI recognised third party audit agencies. As per the reports, a total of 37 municipal slaughter houses have been audited across the country. In respect of the slaughter houses which were found to be non-compliant, Commissioner of Food Safety of the concerned State/UT have been advised to issue necessary instructions to improve the hygienic and sanitary conditions as per the provisions prescribed under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and Rules and Regulations made thereunder. Further, in the second phase of the campaign, FSSAI has requested all State/UT Governments to conduct food safety audit of all central and state licensed slaughter houses in the country. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">FSSAI has also launched a ‘hygiene rating’ scheme aimed at improving the standards of food hygiene in food businesses whereby various categories of food businesses, including meat retail shops, have been encouraged to obtain ‘hygiene rating’. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Further, the implementation and enforcement of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 primarily rests with the State/UT Governments. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Regular surveillance, monitoring and inspection is undertaken by State/UT Governments to check compliance of the provisions laid down under Regulation 2.5 of Food Safety and Standards (Food Product Standards and Food Additives) Regulations, 2011 relating to quality standards for meat and meat products along with guidelines for hygienic and sanitary practices prescribed in Schedule 4 of Food Safety and Standards (Licensing and Registration) Regulations, 2011. </p>
