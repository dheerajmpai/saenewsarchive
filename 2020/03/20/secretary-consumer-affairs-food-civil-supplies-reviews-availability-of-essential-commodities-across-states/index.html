The Secretary advised the States &#038; UTs to ensure there is no shortage of essential supplies including hygiene products such as hand sanitizers and masks that have been recently brought under the Essential Commodities Act, especially in areas where prohibitory orders are in force. He also asked them to constantly monitor prices of commodities under the EC Act. The Department has issued orders today to regulate them under fixed prices.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">A few States have made available hygiene products such as hand sanitizers and face masks for sale through the PDS network. The Secretary advised that others States may also follow the model. Industry representatives have also shown interest in distributing such hygiene products at lower prices through the Fair Price Shops, he said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Secretary said the Centre has issued orders that States can lift foodgrains supplies for upto six months and pass on to retailers so that consumers can stock at homes.

State representatives informed the Secretary the States are not facing supplies shortage including that of fruits, vegetables and milk and have adequate stocks while ramping up production of hygiene products. Director, Civil Supplies, Kerala requested that since the State does not produce foodgrains, it may be ensured that truck movements carrying EC stocks are allowed from other states that have enforced travel restrictions. States/UTs were advised that transport of essential supplies including food and hygiene products across the States/UTs must be maintained. States/UTs could however put requirement and tracking of hygiene of drivers/helpers at the entry points.</p>
