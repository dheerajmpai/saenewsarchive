Various initiatives are taken from time to time by different departments of Railways to improve customer convenience. In order to cater to the diverse needs of passengers, there has been a continuous expansion of various on-board and off-board services and facilities to ensure greater choice and variety to the customers. Some of the major initiatives are as under:-</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Changes in system improvements for provision of better services and facilities in the Railways is a continuous and ongoing process.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">On Indian Railways, demand pattern varies train-wise, sector-wise, class-wise and during peak and lean periods. Trains running on popular and convenient timings with lesser stoppages and running time are generally well patronized and experience waiting list almost throughout the year.  However, other trains not having one or all of these features are chosen by passengers for travel only as a second alternative and may not be fully patronized. Further, during peak periods, the demand outstrips the availability and reserved accommodation especially in the trains running on popular routes particularly in upper class gets exhausted within short duration of opening of reservation. However, during lean periods and on other routes, confirmed accommodation is available for longer duration in most of the trains.  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Waiting list of trains is monitored on regular basis and to cater to additional rush during peak periods, special trains are run and load of existing trains are augmented subject to operational feasibility. Further, with a view to providing confirmed accommodation to waiting list passengers and to ensure optimal utilisation of available accommodation, an Alternate Train Accommodation Scheme(ATAS) known as “VIKALP” has been introduced to cover all types of trains on all sectors. For this facility, waiting list passenger has to give an option at the time of booking of ticket and passengers with waiting list status at the time of preparation of first reservation charts are shifted to other trains, subject to availability of vacant accommodation. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Introduction of trains is an ongoing process on Indian Railways, subject to traffic justification, operational feasibility, commercial viability, availability of resources, etc.  Indian Railways do not run trains on state-wise basis as railway network and trains run across state boundaries.  </p>
