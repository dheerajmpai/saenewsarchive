Under the provisions of the said Act, a three tier quasi-judicial machinery, called Consumer Fora, has been established at the District. State and National level to provide simple, inexpensive and speedy redressal to consumer disputes. To further improve the consumer protection legislation, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 has recently been enacted, which on coming into operation will replace the existing Consumer Protection Act of 1986. The new Act provides for several measures for simplification of the adjudication process in the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions such as deemed admissibility of complaints if not admitted within twenty-one days, e-filing, videos conferencing for hearing and the provision of Mediation,etc.</p>
