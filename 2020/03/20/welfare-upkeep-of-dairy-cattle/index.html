A few are IGFRI Vision 2020, Vision 2050, All India Co-ordinated Research project on forage crops (AICRP) 2019.

<p style="text-align:justify">Normally the crossbred animals yield higher milk per day than the indigenous cows.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Â A study was conducted by National Dairy Development Board Anand Gujarat on Kankrej breed of indigenous cattle to evaluate the effect of scientifically formulated feeds on the growth rate of calves, Age at Sexual Maturity and Age at First Calving. Scientific feeding resulted in about 40% higher growth rate as compared to traditional feeding. Age at Sexual Maturity was 17 months in animals given scientifically formulated feed as compared to 24 months with traditional feeding. Age at First calving was 28 months in scientifically fed calves as against 47 months under traditional feeding. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Government of India has implemented World Bank externally aided project National Dairy Plan Phase I from 2011-12 to 2018-19 in 18 major milk producing States. Under this programme, 21.57 lakh farmers were educated about the nutritional needs of cows and buffaloes and balanced ration advisories were offered to them through 31,148 Local Resource Persons, covering 33,374 villages in these 18 States. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) Institutes through Mera Gaon Mera Gaurav (MGMG) programme, All India Co-ordinated Research Projects (AICRP), Farmers First Project and SCSP scheme, the dairy farmers have been imparted training on ration balancing programme (based on nutrient requirements) on a regular basis. Farmers have been provided with the user-friendly FEED CHART developed by the ICAR institutes for feeding the dairy cows as per their nutrients requirement. Awareness about the nutritional requirements of dairy cows were also made through periodic trainings of various stake holders such as dairy farmers, dairy cooperatives, State Animal Husbandry Department, Extension officers, KVK officials.</p>
