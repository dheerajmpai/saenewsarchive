This paves the way for the construction of new Parliament building and other projects in the prestigious Central Vista project.  This decision will ensure that the green areas and Public-Semi-Public spaces are adequately compensated or enhanced. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Central Vista of New Delhi houses Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, North and South Block, India Gate, National Archives etc. All these iconic buildings were constructed before 1931, the year in which the new capital was inaugurated. The other office buildings were built on various plots subsequently to address the office requirements of Central Ministries and Departments in an unplanned manner.Parliament House building came up in 1927 and is declared Heritage building. Its facilities and infrastructure are inadequate to meet the current demand. Therefore, there is an imperative need to construct a new state-of–art Parliament building in close vicinity. This proposal may address not only the space requirement but may result into an iconic structure as a symbol of democracy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The offices of the Central Government are spread over different locations which affects inter-departmental coordination, and unnecessary travel leading to congestion and pollution. Further, most of the existing buildings have outlived their structural lives. The Hutments, which occupy huge area in the Central Vista, came up as temporary structures during the Second World War. Development of Common Central Secretariat will create modern workspaces with latest technology for better productivity and efficient utilization of human resources.Rajpath and avenue in Central Vista which includes greens and water bodies adjoining it, symbolizes the magnificence of the Capital City and is a tourist place of national importance. Upgrading its facilities and rejuvenating the green spaces is necessary. In view of the above, we have taken up the Central Vista Development/ Redevelopment Project.</p>
