<p style="text-align:justify">It is clarified that NITI Aayog has never proposed or even discussed inclusion of egg, meat, fish or any other livestock item under PDS or any other nutrition intervention programme. The news contained in some of the newspapers is mischievous and without any basis. NITI Aayog would like to ensure all concerned that it does not propose to make any such suggestion or recommendation that hurts the sentiments of any section of the society.</p>
