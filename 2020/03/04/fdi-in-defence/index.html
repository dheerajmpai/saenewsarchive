Further,  Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, Ministry of Commerce &#038; Industry vide Press Note No. 5 (2016 Series) has allowed FDI under automatic route upto 49% and above 49% through government route wherever it is likely to result in access to modern technology or for other reasons to be recorded. As per the data furnished by 79 companies operating in Defence and Aerospace sector, so far, FDI inflows of over Rs. 1834 crores have been reported under both government and automatic route till December, 2019. By allowing higher FDI in the Defence sector, the global companies having high-end technologies can be encouraged to set up their manufacturing base in India in collaboration with Indian companies, thereby resulting in creation of employment opportunities, saving of foreign exchange and increasing indigenisation. FDI is one of the sources available for the industry to access some of the technologies required to indigenously design, develop and produce the equipments, weapon systems/platforms required for defence. </p>
