RoDTEP is based on the principle that taxes and levies borne on the exported products should be either exempted or remitted to exporters unlike the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS), which is an export incentive scheme.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">RoDTEP Scheme is being conceptualized keeping in view the WTO provisions, particularly the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM).</p>
