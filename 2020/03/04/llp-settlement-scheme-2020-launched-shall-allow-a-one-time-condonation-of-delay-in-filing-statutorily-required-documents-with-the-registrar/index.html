<p style="text-align:justify">As part of Government’s constant efforts to promote ease of doing business  it has been decided to give a One-time relaxation in additional fee to the defaulting LLPs to make good their default by filing pending documents and to serve as a  compliant LLP in future.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Accordingly, the Central Government has decided to introduce a scheme namely “LLP Settlement Scheme, 2020”, by allowing a One-time condonation of delay in filing statutorily required documents with the Registrar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">LLPs, that wish to avail themselves of the scheme, may file the pending documents/Forms and make good the defaults, to gain immunity from prosecutions for such defaults.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Scheme shall come into force on the 16th March, 2020 and shall remain in force up to 13th June, 2020.  It would be applicable to a “defaulting LLP” for filing overdue documents, which were due for filing till 31st October, 2019 on a payment of a nominal additional fee of Rs 10/- per day for the period of delay, in addition to any fee as is payable for filing of such document or return, subject to a maximum amount of Rs. 5,000/- as additional fee per document.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Scheme shall apply to the filing of the following documents:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">&#8211; 2 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Scheme is being introduced in pursuance of the Government’s objective of providing greater Ease of Living to the citizens of the country and is expected to provide a significant relief and a window of opportunity for LLPs to abide by the Law &#038; conduct business accordingly.</p>
