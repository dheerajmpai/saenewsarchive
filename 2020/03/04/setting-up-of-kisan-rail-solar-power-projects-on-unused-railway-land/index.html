<p style="text-align:justify">Ministry of Railways is planning for installation of solar panels on unutilized Railway land for meeting its energy needs for both traction and non-traction purpose. So far, a total of 3 MW has already been set up on railwayâ€™s unused land. Further, action taken for installation of Solar power projects on unused Railway land are as follows: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The solar power so generated, shall be evacuated to proliferate either by connecting it to Grid or feeding it directly to 25 Kilo Volt (kV) Alternating Current (AC) Traction System. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In addition to above, IR is further planning to proliferate land based solar power on unused vacant Railway land having no commercial value or future infrastructure requirement once above pilot projects are commissioned successfully. Blue Print for implementation of the project on larger scale is still under preparation. </p>
