<p style="text-align:justify">Following is the full text of the message &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of our country on the auspicious occasion of ‘Ugadi, Gudi Padava, Chaitra Sukladi, Sajibu Cheiraoba, Navreh and Cheti Chand’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">These festivals, celebrated with much zeal around the country, herald the arrival of spring and the beginning of a new year. It is a joyous festival signifying growth and prosperity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As we rejoice and hope that these festivals bring better health and greater happiness in our lives, we should recognize that we are currently battling an unprecedented global health challenge. We have to take adequate precautions to stay safe. I appeal to the people to celebrate these festivals within their homes and avoid large gatherings. Let us give our complete and unconditional support to our government and our healthcare professionals in the war against COVID- 19. Let us adopt a hygienic way of life. If we maintain social distancing and follow medical advice, we can certainly win our collective fight against this deadly virus in the near future.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Share and care is the core of Indian philosophy. Today when most parts of the country are under lockdown to control the spread of COVID- 19, I hope each one of us will do whatever it takes to alleviate human suffering and hardship by providing support to those who need it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As this is a time for new beginnings and new hope, let us be positive and constructive and strive collectively to secure a bright future for this nation and the world. May these festivals bring health, peace, harmony, prosperity and happiness in our lives.”</p>
