<p><strong>Tackling Covid-19 by Janata’s support:</strong></p>



<p>PM Modi announced the creation of ‘COVID-19 Economic Response Task Force’ during his nationwide address on 19th March under the FM. He assured a swift response to the dent on the economy by COVID-19, which is expected to be announced in the next few days.</p>



<p>He also announced the “Janta Curfew” on the 22nd of March to honour the brave Indians at the frontline of the war including medical staff, police, airline staff, government servants,  transport operators, etc. This was lauded by people from all sides of government as a battle cry of unity in the country.</p>



<p>The &nbsp;Indian High Commission Minister Vishwesh Negi told CNBC Wednesday that&nbsp;O’Neill’s comments were “ill-informed and irresponsible.” He adds, “The next sortie by the Indian Air Force aircraft to evacuate Indian national is expected in couple of days. An Indian medical team is already stationed in Qom, Iran to assist the local authorities in screening COVID-19 cases”. “The above points illustrate to a significant degree India’s pro-active efforts in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 which resultantly has put the actual number of cases within India to a minimal given the size of the population” Negi concluded. </p>
