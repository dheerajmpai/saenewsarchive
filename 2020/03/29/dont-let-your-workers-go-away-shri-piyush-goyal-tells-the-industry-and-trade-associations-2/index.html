Talking to representatives from various manufacturing, industry and trading associations from across the country today through video conference, he said that they are not only their assets and resources, but also could become potential carrier of COVID-19, if they are allowed to migrate en-masse throughout the country and countryside, during this pandemic. The Minister of State for Chemicals and fertilizers and Shipping (I/C) Shri Mansukh Mandaviya, who was also present in the VC, also stressed on retaining the workers and laborers on the payroll and at the same place.
