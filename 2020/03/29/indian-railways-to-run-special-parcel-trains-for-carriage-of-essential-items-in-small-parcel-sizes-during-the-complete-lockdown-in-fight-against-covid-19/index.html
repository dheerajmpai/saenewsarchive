<p style="text-align:justify">Transportation of essential items like medical supplies, medical equipment, food, etc in small parcel sizes is going to be very important during the lockdown in the wake of COVID19.  In order to fill in this vital need, Indian Railways has made railway parcel vans available for quick mass  transportation across the nation for the needy E Commerce entities and other customers including State governments to transport such goods. It may be noted that Ministry of Home Affairs has already removed the restrictions on movement of  goods  and commodities in the country during the lock down period. Provision of Parcel trains and  rapid transportation of goods will further bolster the efficiency of supply chains. The decision to run Special Parcel Trains will help in movement of small quantities as well of essential items viz.
