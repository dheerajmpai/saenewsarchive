As such, there is no proposal to launch a Special Recruitment Drive for filling up the vacancies for PwDs in consultation with State Governments.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">    As per data obtained from various Central Government Ministries/ Departments which also include vacancies in Central Public Sector Undertakings, Nationalised Banks and Financial Institutions, etc, of the 15000 vacancies for PwDs identified in 2015, a total of 14263 have since been filled up. These vacancies, inter alia, included backlog vacancies carried forward from earlier years. State-wise data for filling up of vacancies for PwDs is not maintained by Department of Personnel &#038; Training (DoPT). However, DoPT regularly reviews the positions with the Departments/ Ministries of Government of India for expeditious action to fill up the vacancies.</p>
