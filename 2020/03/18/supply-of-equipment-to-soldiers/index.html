The acquisition of such items is undertaken as per laid down specification and authorisation, which is an ongoing process for which necessary steps are taken regularly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Further, there has been no instance of insufficient supply of the requisite sanctioned food for soldiers in high altitude areas in Siachen and Ladakh. The Government has authorised special scales of rations to all troops who are deployed above 12000 feet. The ration scales are designed based upon nutritional requirement of a soldier as per their energy expenditure under different climatic conditions. Soldiers are supplied with the authorised scale of rations, which caters to their nutritional requirement as well as their taste preference.</p>
