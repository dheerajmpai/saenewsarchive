<p style="text-align:justify"> Disposal of RTI applications is the primary responsibility of the State or Central Public Information Officer. Related first appeals are to be disposed by the respective First Appellate Authority and the second appeals by the respective Information Commission. In order to facilitate speedy disposal, the Central Government has taken several steps like issuing instructions impressing upon the Public Authorities to disclose information proactively so that citizens need not resort to filing of RTI applications to access information available with the Public Authorities; and capacity building through training and issue of guidelines for Public Information Officers and First Appellate Authorities to dispose of RTI applications/appeals effectively, resulting into less number of appeals to the Information Commission.</p>
