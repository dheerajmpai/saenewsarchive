<p style="text-align:justify">Emphasising the role of Ayushman Bharat &#8211; Health and Wellness Centres in countering  public health challenges through focus on preventive and positive health, Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated, “Public health is being strengthened through Ayushman Bharat &#8211; Health &#038; Wellness Centres, with screening for BP, diabetes, three types of cancers, leprosy etc. With the dual burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases, there is a need for enhanced focus on preventive health. This has been prioritized in the National Health Policy 2017, as well.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Noting the importance of co-operation among different institutions, he further added, “Synergy between organizations is needed to avoid duplication of efforts especially for organizations in public health. There is huge potential in our institutions but only some of them are utilising their full potential. This is the right time for everyone to put efforts into micro-diagnosis, such as a final push for reduction in MMR, IMR, U5MR. To achieve this objective, fine tuning of our strategy as well as rethinking of our policies is needed. A new approach needs to be taken and Research &#038; Training organisations and public health institutions have to take a lead role. Renewed enthusiasm and dynamic energy are required to achieve this”, he added.</p>
