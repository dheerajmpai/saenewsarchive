This would, however, be subject to the overall time-limit provided in the Code.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The IBBI amended the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 (CIRP Regulations) on 29th March 2020.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Government of India has declared a lockdown of twenty-one days with effect from 25th March, 2020 as a measure to combat and contain the spread of COVID-19. It is difficult for the insolvency professionals to continue to conduct the process, for members of committee of creditors to attend the meetings, and for prospective resolution applicants to prepare and submit resolution plans, during the period of lockdown. Therefore, it may be difficult to complete various activities during a corporate insolvency resolution process within the timelines specified in the CIRP Regulations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The amended regulations are effective from 29th March 2020. These are available at www.mca.gov.in and www.ibbi.gov.in.</p>
