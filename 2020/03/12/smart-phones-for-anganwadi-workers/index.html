<p style="text-align:justify">The target under POSHAN Abhiyaan is to provide Smart Phone based mobile Application to all Anganwadi Centres across 36 States/UTs. As on 29.02.2020, more than 6.25 lakh Anganwadi Workers across 28 States/UTs are using the application for service delivery. Due to delay in procurement of smart phones by the States, some States have not yet provided the smart phones to the Anganwadi Workers.</p>
