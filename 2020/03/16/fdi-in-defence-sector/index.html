By allowing higher FDI  in the Defence sector, the global companies having high-end technologies can be encouraged to set up their manufacturing base in India in collaboration with Indian companies, thereby resulting in creation of employment opportunities, saving of foreign exchange and increasing indigenization.  FDI is one of the sources available for the industry to access some of the technologies required to indigenously design, develop and produce the equipments, weapon systems/platforms required for defence.  As per the data furnished by 37 companies operating in Defence and Aerospace sector, so far, FDI inflows of over Rs 1,561 crore have been reported in defence and aerospace sector after 2014 under automatic route.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">        The Government reviews the FDI policy in all sectors including defence on an ongoing basis and makes changes from time to time, to ensure that India remains an attractive &#038; investor friendly destination.  It has been the endeavour of the Government to put in place an enabling and investor friendly FDI policy.  The intent is to make the FDI policy more investor friendly and remove the policy bottlenecks that have been hindering investment inflows into the country.</p>
