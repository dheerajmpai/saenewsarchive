<p style="text-align:justify">The State-wise targets for construction of NHs are fixed in the beginning of each financial year. Target for construction of 11,000 km of NHs has been set for the country in the current financial year.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Government holds regular review meetings at various levels with Regional Officers, State Governments and concessionaires/contractors to resolve the issues, if any and ensure completion of projects within stipulated time. Road Safety Audits are being carried out at all stages of development of the highway i.e. design / construction / operation stages to minimise accidents. Further, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has taken up installation of crash barriers in hilly terrain on National Highways in predominantly hilly states at accident prone locations. Ministry advocates use of Traffic calming measure at accident prone areas. High priority has been accorded to identification and rectification of black spots (accident prone spots) on national highways.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">All National Highways are constructed as per quality standards specified in Ministry of Road Transport and Highways/ Indian Roads Congress (IRC) specifications. The contractor/ Concessionaire has to prepare a Quality Assurance Plan in consultation with Authority’s Engineer (AE)/ Independent Engineer (IE). The tests on various materials at the specified frequencies have to be conducted by the contractor. The AE/IE has also to conduct certain tests at their level to ensure the quality of the works. The Officers of the Authority also inspect the works and there is provision of engagement of external technical audit to conduct the quality check of works. Maintenance of stretches of NHs, where either Development works have commenced or Operation, Maintenance and Transfer (OMT) Concessions/ Operation and Maintenance (O&#038;M) Contracts have been awarded, are the responsibility of the concerned Concessioners/ Contractors till the Concession Period/ the Defect Liability Period (DLP). Maintenance of balance stretches of NHs, including restoration of damages due to floods, rainfalls, etc., on such stretches, are carried out annually as per available budgetary outlay, inter-se priority and traffic density to keep such NHs in traffic worthy conditions.</p>
