<p style="text-align:justify">DoS have reported that ISRO has transferred this technology to five industries in India to manufacture the receivers. The Fisheries Department of various coastal States have been made aware of this technology for the fishermen community. ISRO has distributed about 250 units each to the State Fisheries Department of Kerala and Tamil Nadu for the use of fishermen. ISRO also has proactively conducted trials for fishermen of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Department of Fisheries, Government of Tamil Nadu reported that 200 NAVIC units have been provided to 80 clusters having 10 to 15 deep sea fishing boats of Tamil Nadu. Distribution of NAVIC has to be implemented by the Department of Fisheries of the respective State Governments.</p>
