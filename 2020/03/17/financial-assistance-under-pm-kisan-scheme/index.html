The data of beneficiaries uploaded by them undergoes a multi-level verification and validation by various concerned agencies, including the banks, which includes rejection of data for errors at various levels and re-uploading of error-free data by the State / UT Governments. Thereafter only the amount is successfully transferred into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. Based on the completely error-free data uploaded by the Government of Maharashtra, as on 31.3.2019 i.e. for the 1st period of 2018-19, financial benefit had been released to 19,24,874 beneficiaries. However, so far (as on 11.3.2020), the benefit has been released to 88,58,291 beneficiaries from the State.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Till 30.11.2019, data of 9,01,60,805 beneficiaries had been uploaded on PM-KISAN portal by the State / UT Governments, out of which financial benefit had been released to 7,60,65,061 beneficiaries across the country, including 70,47,466 beneficiaries from Maharashtra based on verified data. Rest of data was under correction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Though the PM-KISAN Scheme has been successfully implemented across the country with total coverage of 8,69,79,391 beneficiaries as on 11.3.2020, State Governments have been continuously requested and vigorously pursued for expeditious registration, correction, and uploading of data of remaining beneficiaries, in mission mode and by organizing camps. A weekly meeting is held through Video Conferencing with State Governments and other concerned stakeholders so as to remove any obstacles coming in the way of smooth and seamless implementation of the scheme. On the advice of the Union Government, the States have been organizing publicity/awareness camps and saturation drives to achieve 100% saturation by enrolling every eligible farmer family of the country.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Further, a special facility has been provided to the farmers in the PM-Kisan portal, namely, ‘Farmers Corner’, through which, farmers can do their self-registration. Farmers can also edit their names in PM-Kisan database as per their Aadhaar card through the Farmers Corner. Farmers can also know the status of their payment through the Farmers Corner. Village-wise details of beneficiaries are also available on the Farmers Corner. The Common Service Centres (CSCs) have also been authorized to do registration of the farmers for the Scheme upon payment of minimal fees. The other facilities on Farmers Corner are also available through CSCs. A special Mobile APP has also been launched on 24th February, 2020 on the 1st anniversary of completion of one year of successful implementation of scheme, which provides the facilities available through the Farmers Corner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Government of West Bengal, which has not yet joined the scheme, thereby denying its benefit to around 69 lakh farmers of the State, has also been repeatedly requested to join the scheme.</p>
