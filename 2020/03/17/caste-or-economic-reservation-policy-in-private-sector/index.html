So far 9 meetings of Coordination Committee have been held. In the first Coordination Committee meeting, it was stated that the best course for achieving progress on the issue of affirmative action is through voluntary action by the industry itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In the context of reservation in private sector, the Industry representatives are of the view that reservation is not a solution but are willing to partner with the Government and appropriate agencies in enhancing and expanding current recruitment policy for the marginalized section, especially the SC and ST at all levels, as also to encourage skill development and training.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Accordingly, the Apex Industry Associations have prepared Voluntary Code of Conduct (VCC) for their member companies centred around education, employability, entrepreneurship and employment to achieve inclusion. Measures undertaken by the member of Industry Associations, inter-alia, includes scholarships, vocation training, entrepreneurship development programmes and coaching etc. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In the 9th meeting, Industry  Associations were requested to take more proactive measures under affirmative action in terms of conducting full day sessions with their member companies for this initiative, adoption of villages and encouragement of SC/ST entrepreneurs, merit scholarships to research scholars, and the career guidance programmes for Tribal Students and support and contribute in the National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme of Ministry of Skill Development &#038;Entrepreneurship and explore the possibility of placement as well. Industry Associations were further requested to enroll at least 25% of Apprentices from SC/ST Communities.</p>
