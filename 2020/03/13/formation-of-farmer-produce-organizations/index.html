<p style="text-align:justify">
<p style="text-align:justify">Under the scheme, a total number of 2000 FPOs have been proposed to be formed in 2020-21. No state-wise target has been decided as the FPOs will be formed based on justified produce clusters. Under the scheme, it will be ensured that adequate support is extended to States of North East and hilly areas to offset deficiency in specialized manpower and expertise available in such areas. The minimum members per FPO in case of plain areas will be 300; while in North-Eastern and Hilly Region, it will be 100.</p>
