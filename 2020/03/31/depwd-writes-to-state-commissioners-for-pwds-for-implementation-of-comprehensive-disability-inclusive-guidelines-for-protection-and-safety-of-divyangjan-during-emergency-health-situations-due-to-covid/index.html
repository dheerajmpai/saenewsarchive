<p style="text-align:justify">In the letter, it has been said that as per these guidelines, the States Commissioners are required to serve as State Nodal Authority to ensure implementation in close coordination with all relevant authorities such as State/District Disaster Management Authorities, Health and Law Enforcement Authorities so that hardship to persons with disabilities during the lockdown period is minimised. It is hoped that the State Commissioners are taking necessary action proactively in accordance with the above guidelines. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As per these guidelines, (a) local movement passes for caregivers of persons with disabilities during lockdown needs to be issued in a simplified manner on priority, and (b) the persons with disabilities are also required to be given access to essential food, water, medicine. It may further be noted that NGOs and Association of PwDs are also working to assist Divyangjan in their daily living and essential items. There is need to have coordination with these organizations to ensure smooth flow of support services for PwDs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">DEPwD has been receiving complaints regarding difficulties being faced by PwDs in getting services of caregivers, maids and access to essential items due to non-issue of travel passes to NGOs/PwD Associations/ caregivers etc. It has requested the State Commissioners for Persons with Disabilities of all States/UTs to tie up with concerned authorities to streamline issue of local travel passes to Association of Divyangjan/NGOs/caregivers so that there is no delay in providing necessary support to Divyangjan. They are also requested to sensitise local law enforcement authorities in this regard (Police/SDM etc.). DEPwD has asked them to ensure that PwD COVID-19 patients are not turned out from hospitals and health care institutions. </p>
