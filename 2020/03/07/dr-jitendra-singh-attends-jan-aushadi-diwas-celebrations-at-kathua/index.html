<p style="text-align:justify">Special arrangements were made to telecast Prime Minister, Narendra Modi`s interaction with owners of Jan Aushadhi Kendras and beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) across the country through video conference.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Highlighting the importance of celebrating this day, Dr. Singh said that Jan Aushadhi Diwas aims to provide further impetus and create awareness about the use of generic medicines in India. The day also highlights the initiatives taken by the Government in the direction of making quality healthcare affordable for all, like Ayushman Bharat, PMBJP, etc, he added.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Listing the benefits of the scheme, he said the  Government launched the Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Pariyojana(PMBJP) to promote affordable and quality generic medicines among the people. “The Government plans to have atleast 1 PMBJP Kendra in each block of the country by the end of 2020,” Dr. Singh said. He also said that these Kendras have been established to provide generic drugs, which are available at lesser prices but are equivalent in quality and efficacy as expensive branded drugs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“Expensive medicines are affecting adversely the budget of common man and Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) like Hypertension and Diabetes are spreading their tentacles with enormous speed compelling the patients to take medicines on daily basis. For such affected persons these Jan Aushadhi Kendras prove to be a boon,” Dr. Singh informed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Highlighting the achievements of Union government, the Minister said that Kathua has emerged as Education and health services hub with the  establishment of several colleges and Hospitals. He said several obsolete and defunct laws have also been repealed. </p>
