<p style="text-align:justify">“I am happy to learn that World Tuberculosis Day is being observed on 24th March, 2020 to commemorate the anniversary of Dr. Robert Koch’s discovery of the Tuberculosis (TB) bacteria in 1882.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Government of India has committed to eliminate prevalence of TB by 2025, with commensurate resources to rapidly reduce TB incidence prevalence and mortality in India. I appreciate the Ministry of Health &#038; Family Welfare for implementing the National Strategic Plan (NSP) for Tuberculosis Elimination (2017-2025). The Ministry deserves to be complemented for working tirelessly to improve quality of treatment and to create comprehensive support systems for TB patients.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">On this occasion, I appeal to all the stakeholders to come together to reinforce the efforts in &#8220;TB Harega Desh Jeetega Campaign&#8221; and to ensure that this campaign becomes truly a people&#8217;s movement”.</p>
