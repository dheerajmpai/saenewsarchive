Venkaiah Naidu today made a fervent appeal to the people of the country to confine themselves to homes tomorrow (on 22nd March, 2020) so as to effectively contain the spread of Coronavirus. He said that since the virus spreads through physical contact, social distancing is an effective measure to contain its spread by avoiding contact during the incubation period of the virus.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">                Shri Naidu elaborated that the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s call for observing ‘Janata Curfew’ this Sunday in effect means ‘caring for yourself and others’ through social distancing which is being principally advocated by the medical experts and WHO.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">               Shri Naidu urged the political parties, civil society organizations and all other concerned to rise to the occasion to collectively combat the challenge posed to the nation by Coronavirus. He further said that it is the responsibility of every citizen to educate and motivate others towards meeting the challenge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Following is the full text of appeal made by the Vice President of India –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> “The outbreak of Coronavirus as a pandemic is a challenge to all the nations across the globe. India and the rest of the world are passing through an unprecedented health emergency due to the pandemic caused by the outbreak of COVID-19.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This extraordinary situation demands extraordinary measures and the Indian Government led by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has been at the forefront in combating the spread of the deadly virus and protecting the health and well-being of all Indians.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Efforts are being intensified all over to combat this unprecedented challenge. Efforts being made in our country in this regard have so far yielded positive results and the World Health Organisation (WHO) has even lauded our endeavors. But there is no place for complacency. We shall persist with our ongoing collective efforts by further intensifying them so that we avoid entering the critical third phase of community contamination. The next few weeks will be very crucial to not let the virus go beyond the second phase in our country.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It is being widely advocated by the experts and WHO to maintain social distancing to effectively contain the spread of virus. The clarion call given by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi for observing voluntary ‘Janata Curfew’ tomorrow is aimed at meeting this objective. Staying at homes for the suggested period that goes beyond the incubation period prevents the spread of this dreaded virus by breaking the contamination circle. This is all about caring for you and for others in the same vein. This is in line with our traditional ethos of ‘care and share’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I fervently appeal to the people of the country not to venture to move out of their homes tomorrow as it will go a long way in checking the spread of the virus which is proving to be an unprecedented challenge to the governments and the people across the globe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In this hour of national challenge, I urge upon all the political parties, Civil Society Organisations, all others concerned including the people to rise to the occasion in unison and put their best foot forward.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">We are all together in it and we have to fight and overcome this crisis together.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This threat to humanity must bring all together by putting aside differences and political rivalries. All must play constructive role in preventing the transmission of COVID-19.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It shall be the duty of every citizen to inform, educate and motivate fellow citizens to adopt necessary precautions by way of sanitation and social distancing to contain the challenge. Coronavirus is no doubt a serious issue but it’s adverse impacts can be minimized through resolve and restraint.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">When a country faces major epidemic, it is a duty of people and people’s representatives to work and care together in a responsive manner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Let us stay at our homes. Avoid pilgrimages for time being. Postpone such tours and so called holidays, if any. The basic principle of religion and spirituality is cleanliness. That is why Mahatma Gandhi said that cleanliness is next to godliness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Our religious and spiritual heritage highlights the importance of hygiene, both personal and external. These traditions should inspire us to maintain a high level of sanitation and be successful in containing the spread of virus.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Huge quantity of information is being shared on the social media about this virus. No one should blindly forward/share unauthenticated information about the preventive measures and the remedies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">A wide range of people including the doctors and para medical personnel have been rendering yeoman service in facing the Coronavirus challenge. It is our duty to acknowledge their spirited efforts in these testing times. So, let us convey our appreciation to them by wholeheartedly applauding them by clapping on Sunday. This applause will be a resonance of our collective commitment, of  our indomitable spirit and boundless energy. It also conveys a spiritual message.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Our country has so far done well and, if we get our act together, emerge as the role model in meeting the challenge of Coronavirus.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I compliment the central and State Governments, medical professionals and all others concerned for their spirited efforts to meet the formidable challenge of the Coronavirus so far and expect the same to continue till the virus is finally defeated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The road ahead is uncertain, but certainly, it is likely to be very rough.  We have to heed the warnings, take all the needed steps to ward off a major disaster and stand united in taking concerted, collaborative action. The wake up calls from the medical fraternity and the clarion call of the Prime Minister should spur all of us to take on the emerging challenges with courage and confidence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Please confine to homes this Sunday and, as you take the needed precautions to keep the virus away,  be guided by the essential spirit of social distancing thereafter.”</p>
