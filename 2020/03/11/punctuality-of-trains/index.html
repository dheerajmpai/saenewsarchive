However, trains do get delayed not only due to the factors related to its internal working but also due to external factors which are beyond the control of Railways. In addition to asset failures, train running and punctuality is affected by factors such as line capacity, terminal capacity, constraints on account of inadequate infrastructure, increasing passenger and freight traffic, adverse weather conditions (fog, rains, breaches), intermittent natural calamities such as floods, cyclones, heavy rains, heavy road traffic at level crossing gates, law &#038; order problems, miscreant activities such as theft of Railway assets, mid-section run over cases involving cattle and humans, etc. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In order to ensure timely operation of passenger trains, Railways has taken numerous steps which include: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Indian Railway Signalling assets are continuously being upgraded to install Modern Signalling System for timely operation of Passenger trains &#038; reducing the journey time. The status of Signalling asset as on 31.01.2020 are as under:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Modernization of Signaling is proposed to be taken up on Golden Quadrilateral (GQ) and Golden Diagonal (GD) routes. The work includes Automatic Train Protection (ATP) System. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Indian Railways have decided to implement Automatic Train Protection (ATP) System on selected sections. These Systems enable Loco Pilots to drive trains even during heavy fog as movement authority/ Signal aspect is displayed in the cab of the Loco. This helps Loco Pilot to run the train confidently even during impaired visibility. The following ATP systems are working /in-progress:- </p>
