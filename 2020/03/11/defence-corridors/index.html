Agra, Aligarh, Chitrakoot, Jhansi, Kanpur and Lucknow have been identified.  Similarly, for Tamil Nadu Defence Corridor, five nodes viz.  Chennai, Coimbatore, Hosur, Salem and Tiruchirappalli have been identified.  Till date, six consultation meeting of stakeholders each in Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu were organized across its various nodes.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Setting up of Defence Industrial Corridors  would catalyse indigenous production of defence and aerospace related items, thereby reducing our reliance on imports and promoting export of these items to other countries.  This will lead to achieve India’s goal of self-reliance in defence, generation of direct/indirect employment opportunities and growth of private domestic manufacturers, Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and Star-ups.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Presently, there is no proposal to set up more Defence Indusrial Corridor(s) in the country.</p>
