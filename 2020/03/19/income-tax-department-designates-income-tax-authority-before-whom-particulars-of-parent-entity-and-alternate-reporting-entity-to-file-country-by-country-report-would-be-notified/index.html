<p style="text-align:justify">In order to ensure that a multinational enterprise would report its profit correctly where it is earned, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) had developed an Action Plan called “Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan 13”.  Under BEPS Action Plan 13, all large multinational enterprises (MNEs) are required to prepare a country-by-country (CbC) report with aggregate data on the global allocation of income, profit, taxes paid and economic activity among tax jurisdictions in which they operate. In essence, CbC Report is an annual return that breaks down key elements of the financial statements by jurisdiction. A CbC report provides local tax authorities visibility to revenue, income, tax paid and accrued, employment, capital, retained earnings, tangible assets and activities of the concerned MNE. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This CbC report is used as a corroborating material by Income tax Authorities in carrying out revenue risk assessment. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As per corresponding provisions of Indian Income tax Laws, every MNE group which has a constituent entity resident in India is mandated to notify the Income-tax Department its parent entity and alternate reporting entity and the countries where such entities are resident.
