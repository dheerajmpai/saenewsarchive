This step has been taken to discourage them from making non essential journeys. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It has been seen that the risk of spread and mortality rate due to COVID-19 virus is highest among senior citizens as susceptibility increases with age. As the report of the WHO Joint Mission on Corona virus Disease indicates, “Individuals at highest risk for severe disease and death include people aged over 60 years”. It further says, “Mortality increases with age, with the highest mortality among people over 80 years of age (CFR 21.9%).” </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Amidst the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 virus and increasing number of cases in India, it has become imperative to curtail its spread and protect the most vulnerable group of population i.e  people with chronic illness and especially senior citizens. Withdrawal of such concessions is also a part of a wider plan to discourage unnecessary travel by all concerned and hence concessional booking of all tickets have been withdrawn except Patients, students and Divyangjan category for both Unreserved &#038; Reserved segments  . </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It is notable that a large number of requests are already being received by Indian Railways for cancellation of tickets booked by Senior Citizens and provide waiver of cancellation fee. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In view of the above, following action is being taken by Railways:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Railways is taking all precautionary steps for the passengers. Active cooperation of all is required  to combat the spread of COVID-19 virus. </p>
