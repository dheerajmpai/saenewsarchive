As a result, waiting time in FASTag lanes has significantly reduced. However, the waiting time in the hybrid lane which accepts cash has increased because of non-FASTag vehicles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The automated IT system of collection of fee through FASTag provides for discounts for up-and-down/return journeys through toll gates.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">FASTag related issues and complaints at fee plazas of National Highways (NH) are addressed through a central NH Helpline Number 1033. Most of the complaints are resolved instantly by the customer executive. Other complaints are forwarded to concerned regional office of National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and banks for necessary resolution. Apart from 1033, 24 participating banks of FASTag programme also have their own dedicated customer care helpline to cater to complaints of respective customer base. In view of increasing number of NH stretches and NH fee plazas, NHAI has also strengthened the capacity of NH Helpline 1033 to cater to increased call volume.</p>
