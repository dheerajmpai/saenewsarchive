<p style="text-align:justify">The BBBP scheme was launched by the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, on 22nd January, 2015 at Panipat, Haryana as a comprehensive programme to address the declining Child Sex Ratio (CSR) and the related issues of empowerment of women over a life-cycle continuum. Expanded in a phased manner and currently being implemented in all the 640 districts of the country, BBBP is a step towards the nation’s resolve to accomplish gender equality by promoting and prioritizing the needs and rights of the girl child. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The scheme is a tri-ministerial initiative of the central government ministries of Women &#038; Child Development, Human Resource Development and Health &#038; Family Welfare. A convergent approach and community engagement are the main pillars of the scheme and has resulted in increased awareness and sensitization of masses for accomplishing a gender-neutral society. Capacity building of key stakeholders, flexible adaptation of the Scheme to meet local needs through a District Action Plan and innovative activities, generating awareness through frontline workers and recognizing committed key stakeholders, including BBBP Local Champions are also the key elements of the Scheme.</p>
