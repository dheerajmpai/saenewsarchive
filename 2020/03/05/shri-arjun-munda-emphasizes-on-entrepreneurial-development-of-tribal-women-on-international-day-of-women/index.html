He said that the Central government has taken several important initiatives for the overall development of tribal people, especially tribal women of our country. The Government has launched a special campaign from 1st to 7th March, 2020 in the run up to the International Women’s Day on 8th March this year with Tribal Affairs being the theme on 5th March. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Munda said that during the current academic year, total number of tribal students enrolled in various Eklavya Model Residential Schools across the country is 73145 and out of which 36435 are girl students studying in different EMRSs. Around half of the total students studying in EMRSs are girls which clearly shows that the literacy rate among tribal girls has dramatically improved, which India was lagging behind earlier.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He said that National Scheduled Castes Finance and Development Corporation (NSTFNDC) provides Concessional loan under the scheme &#8216;Aadivasi Mahila Sashaktikaran Yojna&#8217;, under which Scheduled Tribe women can undertake any income generation activity. Loan upto 90 per cent for the scheme costing upto 1 lakh is provided at a highly concessional rate of interest of 4 per cent per annum. Ministry of Tribal Affairs extends its support to NGOs which are concerned with education and health of tribal girls, he added.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Munda said that “PM Van Dhan Yojna”, a recent initiative by Ministry of Tribal Affairs is helping in livelihood generation among tribal women, ensuring maximum benefit through wealth of forest (Van Dhan) i.e. minor forest produce. TRIFED has taken a step forward to promote tribal handicrafts and goods by opening up of new outlets namely, TRIBES INDIA at different locations across the country. Large number of handicraft items in these outlets are produced by tribal women, thus helping tribal women to earn their livelihood and boosting their income.</p>
