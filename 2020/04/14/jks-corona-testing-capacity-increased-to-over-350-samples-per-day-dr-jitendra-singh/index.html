He complimented the health administration and the dedicated team of UT’s medical professionals. He also appreciated Financial Commissioner, Health, J&#038;K, Atal Dulloo for his diligent follow up and close coordination with Central Government authorities. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dr Jitendra Singh further explained that one of the reasons for faster detection in comparatively larger numbers is that earlier there was constraint of being able to send just about 50 samples a day for Corona, which has now increased seven to eight times within a few days. </p>
