All supplies, rations, constructional material and medicines pass over this bridge. Old Bridge developed cracks which could lead to a major catastrophe like on 26 Jul 1992 when a passenger bus fell off the bridge leaving no survivors. With the intervention of DGBR and CE Arunank expeditious sanctions were obtained from the MoD and Arunachal Government.
