<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>This bio-inspired carbon nanostructure can help overcome the bottleneck in the realization of several renewable energy conversion and storage technologies such as fuel cell, biofuel cell, and metal−air battery. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The present strategy enriches a route to synthesize low-cost, highly efficient bioinspired electrocatalyst that is better than commercial <span style="background-color:white">Platinum on carbon</span> (Pt/C) catalyst and could be utilized as next-generation nonprecious carbon-based electrocatalyst for energy conversion and storage applications. The results have been recently published in the journal <span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">Inorganic Chemistry published by the American Chemical Society</span></span>, 2020, (DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.0c00446). </span><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.0c00446"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.0c00446</span></a></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Dr. Ramendra Sundar Dey and his team from INST have explored a highly active Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) electrocatalyst based on binary transition metals Iron (Fe), and Manganese (Mn) and N-doped porous carbon (Fe, Mn, N-FGC), derived from fish gills (FG) acquired as animal waste, which has a unique porous structure and could provide conductive carbon networks after heat treatment and could be an efficient electrode material. The catalyst was able to show active oxygen reduction reaction in a wide range of pH (pH &lt; 1, 7, and &gt;13) and outperformed the commercial Pt/C catalyst. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>They fabricated a homemade rechargeable Zn−air battery (ZAB) with the catalyst as an air cathode, which showed almost stable charge−discharge voltage plateaus after rigorous cycling for a long duration. It surpassed the commercial Pt/C based ZAB performance. The scientists found that the reason behind the outstanding performance of this catalyst is the presence of Fe−Mn based binary moiety, which is actually beneficial for the Oxygen (O<sub>2)</sub> binding and boosting Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) catalytic performances in alkaline medium by weakening the Oxygen-Oxygen bonds.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The researchers have suggested that the careful selection of transition metals and heteroatoms together with engineering the synthesis protocol can pave a new way for exploring highly active low-cost electrocatalyst for efficient and environmentally friendly energy conversion devices.</span></span></p>
