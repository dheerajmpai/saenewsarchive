The medical supplies are being transported to equip the state governments and supporting agencies to combat the contagion effectively and efficiently.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">During the last two days, IAF airlifted essential medical supplies and commodities from nodal points to Guwahati, Dibrugarh and Mohanbari in North Eastern region; Prayagraj, Gorakhpur, Bareilly and Agra in the Central region; and the Union Territories of J&#038;K and Ladakh. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In addition, IAF airlifted critical medical supplies to Male, Maldives as &#8216;Operation Sanjeevani&#8217; on 02 Apr 20. Maldives has faced shortage of essential medical supplies as its connectivity with Indiaâ€“ its main source of medical supplies, was broken after COVID-19 lockdown. Active support of MEA, HQ IDS, MoH&#038;FW and various other government agencies was invaluable to the success of this mission. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Quarantine facilities created at IAF bases across the country continue in a state of readiness. IAF is ever ready and geared up to meet all the emerging needs in support of the nation to fight the pandemic.</p>
