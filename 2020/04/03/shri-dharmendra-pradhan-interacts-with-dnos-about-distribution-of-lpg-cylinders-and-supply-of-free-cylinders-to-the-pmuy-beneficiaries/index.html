Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, and Senior Officers of the Ministry and all three OMCs-IOCL, BPCL, HPCL also attended the webinar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Appreciating the efforts of DNOs and their teams, Shri Pradhan said that in this time of unprecedented crisis, the LPG teams of the companies have risen to the occasion and delivered the cylinders on time despite so many restrictions and health hazards. He said that due to Covid-19 crisis and nationwide lockdown, the consumption and demand of cylinders has gone up. The OMCs are delivering on an average 50-60 lakh cylinders daily, and are playing an important role in the national fight against Covid-19.  The Minister said that they should now gear up to provide 3 free cylinders to over 8 crore PMUY beneficiaries over the next 3 months, as part of the PM Garib Kalyan Yojana. He said that advance funds are being provided to the LPG distributors for releasing the first free cylinder, and the scheme should be implemented efficiently so that poor sections of the society do not suffer in this time of difficulty. The minister also called the OMCs to help the migrants and provide food to them. He called upon the DNOs to generate awareness among the masses and all the stakeholders about health precautions and social distancing. Shri Pradhan also advised all the stakeholders  to take precautions and be careful, as many of them are operating in the hotspots of Corona infection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The DNOs reported that after the initial hiccups, things have settled down. The panic booking of cylinders, which was noticed in the initial few days of the lockdown, has stopped. They also informed that the waiting period of cylinder delivery has come down. They said that announcement of the special ex-gratia of Rs 5 Lakh for LPG delivery boys and others involved in the supply chain, has boosted the morale of the staff at the field level. The DNOs are also publicizing the relief package announced by the Government for PMUY beneficiaries.</p>
