<p><strong><em>Relations between US-Taliban and history of the deal</em></strong></p>



<p>The Taliban is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni">Sunni</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_fundamentalism">Islamic fundamentalist</a> political movement and military organization in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. They ruled in Afghanistan since 1996 until they were overthrown by the British and the American armed forces in 2001, post the September 11 attacks in the US. The US later zeroed in on Osama-Bin-Laden, the head of Al-Qaeda, an Afghanistan based terrorist organization that was responsible for the 9/11 attacks. The Taliban had allowed the setting up of the training camps of Al-Qaeda in their territory, and hence the US not only bombed the Al-Qaeda terrorist base camps but also targeted the Taliban. The US quickly took control of Kabul, and drove the Taliban out of it. Finally, in 2011, the Americans succeeded in killing Osama Bin Laden who was hiding in Pakistan. In 2012, the Taliban and US entered into a deal, which let the Taliban to set up its office in Doha. However, the Taliban canceled the preliminary talks two months later alleging that the US had retracted their promises of taking steps towards prisoner swap. In 2017, Kabul witnessed suicide bombings by the US on the IS, which was evolving in Afghanistan and the Taliban, which was stronger than ever.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>In December 2018, the militants announced that they shall hold talks with the US officials, ready to walk the path of peace, but called off the official talks later on because they refused to speak to the Afghanistan government, calling them puppets of the American Government. On 22<sup>nd</sup> February, a weeklong &#8220;Reduction in Violence&#8221; (RIV) agreement amongst the Taliban, the US and Afghan security forces came into being, finally raising hopes for a resolution to end decades of war. The RIV was successful, with just minor attacks reported. On 29<sup>th</sup> February, an agreement was signed between the US officials and the Taliban representatives in Doha. Trump was caught remarking that a peace agreement was “very close” after the annual security conference held in Munich in February.</p>
<p><strong><em>What is the deal?</em></strong></p>
<p>Signing of the US -Taliban agreement aimed at ending the longest war of Washington, fought in Afghanistan. It offers a ray of hope to the Afghanis of a peaceful and stable future after 40 years of instability and chaos. The deal was signed between the US special envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban political chief Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as a witness. This was also in line with Trump&#8217;s upcoming re-election aspirations, determinate to deliver on the promises to bring the US troops back home.</p>
<p>The agreement contained a detailed timeline on what shall follow for the next 18 months, how the troops shall withdraw, what kind of attacks shall be allowed and so on. For example, the Taliban shall not be allowed to conduct suicide attacks, and the Americans must forego the drone strikes. Shortly before the deal was signed, a joint statement was released by the US and the Afghan government stating that US and NATO troops would withdraw from Afghanistan within 14 months. Trump clearly seems to have a lot of faith in the Taliban. To venture into the nitty-gritties of the agreement, the US assured that it shall reduce its troops in Afghanistan to 8,600 forces, and that their allies would also reduce proportionately. The US shall also fulfill other commitments within 135 days of the announcement of the joint declaration and the US-Taliban agreement. The militants in turn have been told to sever all their ties with the Al-Qaeda and ensure that Al-Qaeda or any other terrorist group is not provided sanctuary in the Afghan territory. The deal also provides for a prisoner swap. Both came to an agreement that by 10<sup>th</sup> march when talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government are slated to begin, 5,000 Taliban prisoners and 1,000 Afghan security force prisoners would be exchanged. Sideways, Trump also gave an assuaging statement that they shall go back in with a lot of force if the situation only seems to deteriorate.</p>
<p><strong><em>Critical analysis of the agreement</em></strong></p>
<p>The agreement is multifaceted and has numerous clauses that will have to be adhered to by both the parties. There is a fair amount of information to critically analyze the same. Firstly, the agreement is classified and is not open to the public. The Trump administration affirms that the information is sensitive and in the interests of national security. Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, House Republican and one of the sharpest critics of the accord, said that the deal fails to put in place monitoring mechanisms by the US to ensure that the Taliban keeps up with their promises and actions. Another issue that has been pointed out is the formation of a committee according to a secret annexure of the deal which would assist communications between both the parties and oversee the fulfilling of the commitments. Here, the composition of the committee still remains unknown to the general public. Of course, the US State Department disagreed and said that all measures were in public interest and in line with public concurrence. The congressmen doubt if any accountability has been fixed on the Taliban for their actions and look at the ability of the Taliban to prevent extremist group Al-Qaeda from operating in Afghanistan with eyes of suspicion. People who have read the agreement feel that the provisions of the deal are so vague that they doubt if the US is at a good position in the bargain. There is still a lot of legitimate fear looming over certain sections of the society including the women. Zahra Husseini, an activist claimed that she fears that the situation of the women in Afghanistan shall worsen after the Taliban would come to power. After all, who can forget the repressive regime and the cruel rules imposed on women in the name of religion by the Taliban, memories of which have the potential to send shivers down the spine of millions. Women fear that the protections that were given to them in the past 18 years would now stand a chance to be bargained away to the Taliban movement. The Taliban leaders come to claim that they have undergone a lot of change since their harsh rule in 1990s, while it is true that they have modified their ideology to some extent but, they still despise women working at higher posts in government and are still stringent about the dress code.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another challenge is that the Afghanistan Government and the Taliban will have to concur at some level to come to a solution and reduce the volatility of the situations that could arise in the future thereby saving this agreement. The problem is that Taliban has always refused to acknowledge Afghanistan as a democratic government, their goal has always been to come to power and establish rule on the basis of their view of Islam. The counter terrorism expert, Mr. Seth Jones, who has also been an adviser to the US Military in Afghanistan opined that the US must have a backup plan in case the agreement between US-Taliban does not work out. Looking at the current scenario as well as paying heed to the past events, this suggestion only seems more vital than ever. It must be noted that there were attacks by both sides within a few days of signing of this agreement, this shows that we must not get our hopes too high about the agreement.</p>
<p><strong><em>Conclusion </em></strong></p>
<p>According to the data provided by the US Central Command Combined Air Operations Center, US air force dropped a record 7,423 bombs on Afghanistan &#8211; more than at any time in the last 10 years. More than 100,000 Afghans have been killed or wounded since 2009. The facts are heart breaking to say the least. But, after incessant talks, deliberations for years and after 18 months of on-and-off negotiations, the agreement outlines the gradual withdrawal of US troops from the country. Some have to say that there is no way the peace is going to be established by the Taliban. They don’t possess the organizational skills and capacity to monitor and influence the internal controls, they don’t understand the concepts of modernity especially in respect of women. empowerment or as simple as giving them basic rights. While there is a lot of skepticism, dubiety about what the agreement shall follow, one thing <em>[This article was a part of the 8th National Article writing competition conducted by The South Asian Express and Think India.
