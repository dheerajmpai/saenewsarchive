<p><strong><em>“War is never a lasting solution to any problem.” <br /></em></strong><em>-Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</em></p>
<h1><a id="post-23320-_t6dck5i6245c"></a>Introduction</h1>
<p>This quote from Dr. Kalam looks relevant when discussing the long drawn inconclusive US-Taliban war. The 19 year tussle between the US and Taliban proves that war is a road to destruction and not to a solution. The only thing every country craves for is peace and that’s why the ‘US-Taliban Peace Agreement’ has been finalized. This agreement has created a historic moment across the globe as it puts an end to the dreadful catastrophe that occurred due to this conflict. Therefore, this article studies each and every aspect of the agreement to understand how it turns out to be the ray of hope for the people of Afghanistan.</p>
<h2><a id="post-23320-_9pcs0egrj1gr"></a>Who are the Taliban?</h2>
<p>Etymologically, the word ‘Taliban’ means ‘students’ in the Pashto language. But in reality, it is an Islamic fundamentalist group who were once in charge of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001. It mainly consisted of students who had been educated in traditional Islamic schools i.e. Madrasa. The primary objective of the Taliban is to establish a so-called unadulterated and true form of Islam in Afghanistan which is a bit extreme notion than that followed in other Islamic states.</p>
<h1><a id="post-23320-_41lvvurmgdb4"></a>A Journey from Brotherhood to Enmity</h1>
<p>The relationship between the US and Taliban is quite interesting. There has always been a curiosity among people to know that despite having such a great bond what was the reason for the separation of US and Taliban. Let us shed some light on the journey of the relationship of the US and Taliban.</p>
<p>Predominantly, the Taliban came into existence after the Afghan Civil War. Both the US and Taliban were on good terms until the terrorist group Al-Qaeda came into the picture. After the termination of the Afghan Civil War, the Taliban got the opportunity to rule over Afghanistan. But the situation in Afghanistan was worse as everything was destroyed due to the war. Under such circumstances, governing a country that had just come out of the war was a big challenge for the Taliban and then the US became the helping hand of the Taliban. It is obvious that having the support of one of the world’s most powerful countries brought back the confidence of the Taliban. Thus, a virtuous relationship was established between the US and Taliban.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Al-Qaeda, a terrorist organization, approached the Taliban asking for sanctuary. The Taliban granted sanctuary on a condition that it did not harm and threaten the US. This deadly cooperation of Al-Qaeda and Taliban annoyed the US. On September 11, 2001, there were four gruesome terrorist attacks on the US by Al-Qaeda. As an outrageous reaction to these attacks, the US under President George Bush asked the Taliban to hand over the prime suspect Osama Bin Laden. This was denied and the Taliban demanded evidence proving the involvement of Osama Bin Laden in the attacks. Accordingly, the US and the NATO allies together launched the United States Invasion of Afghanistan and removed the Taliban from power and thus ending the friendship. In return, the Taliban initiated several attacks on Afghan forces and other organizations that were in support of the US. Since then, the war with Taliban insurgents continues.</p>
<h1><a id="post-23320-_ub0dwe6gpxu8"></a>The Peace Agreement 2020</h1>
<p>Recently, the US and Taliban have signed a peace agreement in Doha, Qatar in February 2020 which aimed at ending this conflict. By the virtue of this agreement, each one of them has committed to the reduction in violence and thus, this deal is considered as the best opportunity to establish peace in Afghanistan.</p>
<h2><a id="post-23320-_c3bgvopsptxw"></a>Highlights of the Agreement</h2>
<p>The Peace Agreement 2020 principally deals with the following four issues:</p>
<h3><a id="post-23320-_s2uwzg5f73ck"></a>Withdrawal of foreign troops</h3>
<p>The United States has consented to decrease the number of US troops in Afghanistan from 12,000 to 8,600 in the first 135 days and will withdraw all their forces from the 5 military bases. Moreover, if the Taliban stick to its obligations and commitments the US will completely withdraw all its remaining troops and forces from the military bases from Afghanistan within the remaining 9.5 months.</p>
<h3><a id="post-23320-_ptzt1y7tqln"></a>Assurance of counter-terrorism</h3>
<p>Fundamentally, the root cause of antagonism between the US and Taliban was the attack of September 11, 2001, led by Al-Qaeda reacting against which the US invaded Afghanistan to eradicate the terrorist activities. Under this peace agreement, the Taliban guaranteed distancing from terrorism and assured the US that Afghanistan will not be used as a safe haven by terrorists ever again to launch attacks on anyone.</p>
<h3><a id="post-23320-_5gp26hjmlvym"></a>Intra-Afghan Negotiation</h3>
<p>In this peace agreement 2020, Taliban admits to something that they have rejected all along. The Taliban showed interest in sitting down with the representatives of the new Afghanistan government that was created while they were dealing with their insurgency.</p>
<h3><a id="post-23320-_u9x7snyaeudt"></a>Ceasefire</h3>
<p>On the issue of the ceasefire, both the parties have agreed to a reduction of violence but permanent and comprehensive ceasefire will be a matter of intra-Afghan negotiations.</p>
<h2><a id="post-23320-_b2phg6f18rud"></a>A Beacon of Hope for Afghan People</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the insurgency in Afghanistan has been persisting for nearly 19 years which signifies that an entire generation was born and reached adulthood in Afghanistan knowing nothing but war. After this deal has been signed, a reduction in violence has been observed in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It is believed that this agreement can work and bring tranquility in Afghanistan because, from roughly 80 attacks per day countrywide, to 10 attacks per day nowadays is a huge reduction in the eyes of Afghan people who suffer the brunt of explosions, suicide attacks, aerial bombardments, and drone attacks. So, nothing like this has ever happened on such a large scale in Afghanistan which has reduced the number of attacks.</p>
<p>If this could continue and gain momentum the day is not far when the people will be back to their ordinary lives, setting down and mapping out the future of Afghanistan.</p>
<h1><a id="post-23320-_kgahiqev7mr"></a>Effect of Peace Agreement on India</h1>
<p>For India, this deal is not on the positive side because it was clearly seen after Trump visit to India that the countries share the strategic concerns and moreover India and in case if the US withdraws from the region it will be in violation of Trumps’ agreement. Also one should not forget that Indian government is keeping resolutely only political ties with Kabul. This incautious negotiation made by the U.S. will likely to cause disruption in South Asia in the years to come. This agreement can pose several challenges for India.</p>
<h1><a id="post-23320-_m18dl2yubxf8"></a>Drawbacks</h1>
<p>It is genuinely impossible to have an agreement without drawbacks. This agreement also has certain limitations. Some are discussed below:</p>
<h2><a id="post-23320-_gk6tpisaeatc"></a><strong>It excludes women’s rights:</strong></h2>
<p>The majority of the Afghan population is made up of women yet this excludes their rights. No safeguard is provided to women&#8217;s rights or human rights that are expressed in the Constitution which is not recognized by the Taliban. Millions of Afghan women, girls are subject to extreme ferocity, persecution, intolerance that they have suffered for years. This agreement was hope for them but it also fails to address such problems. That&#8217;s why Afghan women are in jeopardy.</p>
<h2><a id="post-23320-_9ckp34qix203"></a><strong>The clause related to “Not to facilitate harm to the U.S.A. and its allies”:</strong></h2>
<p>This clause is only secured by a promise. The Taliban has decided to carry on their operations against the Kabul administration but will not facilitate harm to the U.S. and its allies. The release of 5000 prisoners had already proven to be problematic on the part of Afghan Government as they are not ready for the same.<a id="post-23320-_mw3lyis8e3bz"></a>Conclusion</p>
<p>It can be concluded that the peace agreement paves the way for the US to gradually withdraw its troops from Afghanistan and in return, the Taliban have promised not to allow the country to be used as a base for terrorist attacks against the rest of the world.</p>
<p>This agreement will hopefully lead to peace and stability but there is a need to be very careful because the real work still lies ahead. This agreement does not involve any representation of the Afghanistan government and that is the next big step to happen before anyone can call this a successful Afghan Peace deal. People of Afghanistan have suffered abundant loss due to war and all they wish for now is the end of violence. Keeping this in mind the agreement of 2020 is a ray of hope to the people as they believe that it could offer a chance to live their rest of life in peace.</p>
