<p>Turning the pages of history books have shown us innumerable armed conflicts between two or more states, fighting for their territories demarcated by their forefathers, or a weak yet resourceful country being colonized by a strong and dominant country. However, the end of World War II and the Failure of the League of Nations recognized a need for a stronger body for peacekeeping among the States around the world, and thereby United Nations was formed, replacing the League of Nations. The United Nations General Assembly thereafter drafted a UN Charter, laying down certain principles for the nations to strictly follow, including maintaining International Peace and Harmony.<sup><a id="post-23319-footnote-ref-2" href="#post-23319-footnote-2">[1]</a></sup> However, it has not always been the case. The battles have been reduced to civil wars, fight against British Colonialism and for ownership of essential minerals. This article shall deal with how the Israel-Palestine Dispute shaped up and why India has the final opportunity to settle this dispute peacefully and in the interest of both the States through the mode of Mediation.</p>
<p><strong>Israel-Palestine Dispute</strong></p>
<p>The dispute between Israel and Palestine is considered to be one of the longest and most controversial disputes between any two states in recorded history. The war for territory has seen major developments in the two sides, however, none of them ever reaching a conclusion. Israel is a predominantly Jewish Zionist State, whereas Palestine is an Arab Muslim State, located in the Middle-East Asia. The conflict can be divided among the two states into four phases. However, for the purpose of this Article, the focus shall be solely on the fourth and the ongoing phase, after the “peace process” ended in 2001.</p>
<p>Since the year 1948, when Israel fought the war with the Arabs, there have been tensions regarding ownership of the territory between Israel, Syria, Jordan, and Palestine for the land between the East and the West Bank of the Jordan River. Syria and Jordan were soon out of the picture, after demarcating their own territories. However, there were two masses of land, which were claimed by the Palestinian Jews, namely Gama and the West Bank, which fall in the territorial region of Israel. Moreover, there were constant disturbances by the Israelis in the West Bank and Gama, which kept the fire ablaze.</p>
<p><strong>Legitimacy Of Mediation In International Diplomatic Disputes</strong></p>
<p>There have been multiple examples, where a third-party nation has stepped in between to resolve disputes between two states. Article 31 of the UN Charter<sup><a id="post-23319-footnote-ref-3" href="#post-23319-footnote-3">[2]</a></sup> lays down multiple options for settling of disputes, for example, Arbitration, Mediation, Negotiation, Conciliation, etc. There is no compulsion on the States to choose a particular mode of resolution. The mediation between Egypt and Israel by the United States ended the conflict with the 1978 Camp David Peace Negotiations.<sup><a id="post-23319-footnote-ref-4" href="#post-23319-footnote-4">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>It has not always been the pretty picture for Diplomatic Mediations, as the closest example is the mediation by the United States, and the intervention by the USSR, in this conflict between Israel and Palestine itself.<sup><a id="post-23319-footnote-ref-5" href="#post-23319-footnote-5">[4]</a></sup> The negotiations went for a number of years, before the Palestine chose to revolt against the United States, for taking side the of Israel.<sup><a id="post-23319-footnote-ref-6" href="#post-23319-footnote-6">[5]</a></sup> Therefore, the mediation conducted between the states by a third-party state is legitimate under the International Law. However, there is no guarantee that the settlement may ever see the light of the dawn, as the history has suggested.</p>
<p><strong>Can India Deliver Up to The Expectations of the United Nations?</strong></p>
<p>In the first week of March, 2020, a delegation of the United Nations Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People visited India on a two-day tour to hold talks with the Foreign Ministry regarding the settlement of age-old dispute between Israel and Palestine.<sup><a id="post-23319-footnote-ref-7" href="#post-23319-footnote-7">[6]</a></sup> Looking at the history from an Indian point of perspective, India has never interfered in foreign disputes, with the only exception being the separation of Pakistan and Bangladesh, where India had to intervene involuntarily, and was successful in helping Bangladesh part its ways with Pakistan forming a new country. India is always thought as a peace-making nation, and was at an arm’s length from International Disputes.<sup><a id="post-23319-footnote-ref-8" href="#post-23319-footnote-8">[7]</a></sup> Therefore, the primary question that arises is whether India is fit to mediate between two countries, who have been unable to settle even after interferences from superpowers such as The United States of America, The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (now Russia) and the United Nations?</p>
<p>The answer to the abovementioned question lies in the basic guiding principles of Mediation. Mediation is no more than a situation where a third neutral party sits amongst the two parties in conflict, tries to initiate communication between them, finds common grounds in the dispute, and if possible, settle the dispute as amicably as possible, keeping in mind the interests and satisfaction of both the parties. Thus, if the representatives of India find a way to follow the principles, there lies no reason why the Mediation between the parties shall fail. However, Mediation between two Independent Sovereign States by another Independent Sovereign State is nothing like two individuals having a dispute. The repercussions of failure of such negotiations may worsen the conflict amongst the states, or may also prove to be fatal.<sup><a id="post-23319-footnote-ref-9" href="#post-23319-footnote-9">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Looking at the relations of India with both Israel and Palestine, there lies a difference as to how the diplomatic relations of India were with these countries and how have they been changed over the period of time. The rule of the Congress Government never publicly supported Israel and maintained positive relations with Palestine Representatives.<sup><a id="post-23319-footnote-ref-10" href="#post-23319-footnote-10">[9]</a></sup> However, after the Modi-led BJP Government, there can be seen a shift in the diplomatic relations of India with Israel. The visits of the Prime Ministers and signing of multiple deals between the states can be seen as a sign of strength and cooperation among the States. On the other hand, there is no deteoriation in the relations with Palestine, and thus, are on the positive side.<sup><a id="post-23319-footnote-ref-11" href="#post-23319-footnote-11">[10]</a></sup> Maintaining positive relations with both parties is necessary in order to remove any bias from the Mediation Sessions.</p>
<p>There also lies a challenge in the hands of India. In the mediations performed by the United States and the USSR, the countries were in a dominant position and thus held authority over the mediation. However, in the present case, India is more or less on the same level with the countries in conflict, and thus does not pose any superiority or dominance in the process, which may be a major issue for resolving the dispute.</p>
<p>Moreover, India itself has been a party in a States’ conflict, where the dispute with Pakistan regarding the Indus Water Utilization, which was eventually settled by the World Bank by offering grants to bring to a settlement and solve the conflict.<sup><a id="post-23319-footnote-ref-12" href="#post-23319-footnote-12">[11]</a></sup>Thus, India is currently in one of the most promising positions to bring a settlement between Israel and Palestine and end the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The reason why the mediation conducted by the United States of America failed was due to the negotiations took too long to come to a conclusion, an underlying reason was the changing Presidents and their different ideologies regarding the dispute. Moreover, the United States build more diplomatic relations with Israel than with Palestine, thereby creating a bias in the process, which eventually failed the Mediation.<sup><a id="post-23319-footnote-ref-13" href="#post-23319-footnote-13">[12]</a></sup> In my opinion, India is competent enough to resolve this dispute, by strictly following the principles of mediation and practicing a transformative style of mediation, to end this conflict for once and for all.</p>
