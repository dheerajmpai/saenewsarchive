<p class="has-text-align-justify">Many days have passed since the announcement of LockDown in Maharashtra. As per the guidelines of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Chief Minister, all of us are cooperating in the war against the Coronavirus by not crossing the Laxman Rekha of our home. This is our national duty.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Well, we are safe in our homes with ration, vegetables, milk, and all the food items being easily available. We have the luxury of TV, mobile and our boring days are passing by eventually. But at some distance from our home, there are some houses where the stove is not burning. How will these families who earn daily income fill their stomach when there is no employment? What would such families eat? How would such families get their basic needs? Are they not a part of our society? Again? What can I do for them?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Even in such difficult circumstances, the volunteers of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh without caring for their lives have come forward once again for the sake of service to the country and the society. The volunteer is also the son of a mother, or husband of someone or he can be some sister&#8217;s brother. But, history tells that whenever there is any calamity on the nation &#8211; then the  RSS and its volunteers surrendered itself to the service of the nation.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Even today the same kind of work continues uninterruptedly. The RSS volunteers are continuously moving out of their homes to distribute food packets to the destitute people, distribution of ration materials, security supplies, assisting <a href="https://sae.news/2020/04/12/rsss-mumbai-unit-emerges-as-rescuers-for-the-ne-christians-muslims-and-transgender-indians/">the police employees</a>, boosting their morale. It may sound astonishing while reading that 100 &#8211; 150 women from the house of the Swayamsevaks are sending food to needy without even a wrinkle on their face. Even during these lockdown times, doing national duty, the RSS volunteer is happily serving the nation. For this food to go in the stomachs of the needy, many volunteers are engaged in service work, every day.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">Yesterday a photo of a young RSS volunteer who was sanitizing the service settlements with a machine on his back went viral. Will this work be done from us? I do not even know his name but I am very proud of him, I am proud of his parents who gave birth to such a son and the RSS ideas that made a volunteer working on ground day and night.</p>



<p>May this nation be victorious by defeating the crisis.</p>
