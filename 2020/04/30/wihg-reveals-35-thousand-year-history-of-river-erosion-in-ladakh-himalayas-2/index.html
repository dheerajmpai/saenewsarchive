The study showed how rivers in drier Ladakh Himalaya operated in longer time scales and how they responded to varying climate, an understanding of water and sediment routing,which is crucial as the country gears up its infrastructure and develops smart cities.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The scientists have traced where the rivers draining Himalaya and its foreland erode the most and identify the zones that receive these eroded sediments and fill up. The Ladakh Himalaya forms a high altitude desert between Greater Himalayan ranges and Karakoram Ranges. The Indus and its tributaries are major rivers flowing through the terrain. The Zanskar River is one of the largest tributaries of the upper Indus catchment, draining orthogonally through highly deformed Zanskar ranges.Two prominent tributaries of Zanskar River are the Doda and TsrapLingti Chu, which confluence at Padam village in the upper valley to form the Zanskar River.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>In the study published in the journal Global and Planetary ChangesZanskar catchment was explored by WIHG team to understand the landform evolution in transitional climatic zone, using morpho stratigraphy and provenance study of landforms like valley fill terraces, alluvial fans(<span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:#222222">triangle-shaped deposit of gravel, sand, and even smaller pieces of sediment, such as silt)</span></span>. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Their research suggested that the wide valley of Padam, with an area of 48 square km, in the upper Zanskar, has stored a vast amount of sediments in these landforms. Where, presently, 0.96±0.10 km<sup>3</sup> of sediment is stored in its terraces and fans, and since the last 32 thousand years, 2.29±0.11 km<sup>3</sup> of sediment has been eroded by the river from Padam, giving it a specific sediment yield of 2.2×10<sup>3</sup> tons/km<sup>2</sup> per year.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The sediment contribution from such transient basins is significant when compared with the 4–7 km<sup>3</sup> of sediment reportedly eroded from the entireIndus system in Ladakh since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the 7–22 km<sup>3</sup> from the Zanskar since last 10 thousand years. ThusPadam valley is a hotspot of sediment buffering in the Zanskar. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>A study of the sediments suggested that most sediments were derived from Higher Himalayan crystalline that lie in the headwater region of Zanskar. It was found out that dominant factors responsible for sediment erosion were deglaciation and Indian Summer Monsoon derived precipitation in the headwaters despite the presence of a geomorphic barrier (the deep, narrow gorge) between the upper and lower catchments of the river, and it remained connected throughout its aggradation history.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The study by the WIHG team will help to understand river-borne erosion and sedimentation</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>, which are the main drivers that make large riverine plains, terraces, and deltas that eventually become the cradle to evolving civilizations.</span></span></p>
