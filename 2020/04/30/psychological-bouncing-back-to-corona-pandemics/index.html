<p></p>



<p>Pandemics are not only a clinical marvel; they influence people and society at numerous levels, causing disruptions. Irresistible pandemics and the spread of COVID-19 across nations has resulted in unprecedented human health and economic consequences. This was recognized in December 2019 (Wuhan, Hubei province China),  as of now impacting  205 countries and territories around the world and 2 international conveyances, raising concern and expanding uneasiness in people exposed to the danger of the infection. The global pandemic has confirmed more than one million cases (3,236,296) till  April 2020, further resulting in 228,611 deaths, 1,010,080 recoveries and outbreak continues to spread (<a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/</a>). Corona-virus pandemic dove the world into fear and vulnerability. Epidemics lead to stigmatization of affected individuals. Significantly, these worries emerge with all diseases, including seasonal influenza and a similar general precautionary measure is required and demonstrated for security and the counteraction of further transmission. The alleviation of the pandemic warrants prompt utilization of evidence-based Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) through an engaged and instructed network [1].</p>



<p>Being worried about the news is reasonable, however, for some individuals, it can exacerbate existing emotional well-being issues. The spotlight over the loss of life or contamination pace of a pandemic lamentably overshadows its gigantic psycho-social effect all over the globe. Notwithstanding, media inclusion has featured COVID-19 an exponentially expanding torrent of misinformation constantly, which has added to the stress and the potential for panic, kicking in fear of individuals. The current COVID-19 outbreak is spurring fear on a societal level. On an individual level, it may differentially exacerbate anxiety and psychosis-like symptoms as well as lead to non-specific mental issues. The public health disaster has become a financial catastrophe too, could inflict long-lasting emotional trauma, adding fuel to the fire.</p>



<p>A significant association between chronic diseases and psychiatric impairments is well known in diseases like HIV (human immunodeficiency infection), diabetes, tuberculosis and hypertension [2]. The studies reported a surge in depression rates in anthrax scares and herpes exposure after infection [3,4]. The COVID-19 emergency has joined emotional well-being stressors that have been studied before in other disasters, yet which have never been seen consolidated in one worldwide emergency. One of the key lessons gained from epidemics like SARS and MERS was the requirement for early sensitization of general well-being specialists to the psychological impacts of a pandemic and to consider the emotional well-being needs of those quarantined [5]. The World Health Organisation’s mental health and substance abuse department has accentuated the significance of a psychological well-being reaction to the developing situation. Suicide rates are day by day getting alarming due to the anxiety and fear of COVID-19.</p>



<p>Bizarre of heart-wrenching events took place resulting in panics among the already anxious public. On 4<sup>th</sup> April 2020, a 48-year-old NRI who returned home two days before tried to commit suicide at his house, where he was kept under isolation and observation for Corona infection. Relatives told them he was depressed after he could not mingle with his wife and kid. After being deeply concerned regarding the economic fallout of COVID-19, the finance minister of Germany, Thomas Schaefer, committed suicide on 29<sup>th</sup> March 2020. One can gauge the succumbing mental pressure displayed among the public leaders in  shaky situations of human disasters.&nbsp; A man with cancer hanged himself in a Manhattan hospital after testing positive (27<sup>th</sup> March 2020). On 19<sup>th</sup> &nbsp;March 2020, a man suspected to be infected with COVID-19 (reports were awaited) &nbsp;forced open the isolation ward&nbsp;and allegedly committed suicide by jumping off the seventh floor of Safdarjung hospital, Delhi.</p>



<p>However, sadly the focus point for assessing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is more highlighted towards the expanded mortality, while mental prosperity, one of the most widely recognized markers of general well-being, sadly takes a backseat. It is thus, critical to assess the effects of COVID-19 pandemic that might be affecting individual emotional wellness. </p>



<p>The existential questions of survival and death mainly rise out of ‘fear of uncertainty’ and are compounded by various sources of misinformation. The impact of an unknown infection is much beyond its symptoms, or mortality. There is a lot of misinformation swirling around that can result in mental saturation affecting daily functioning and sleep. So, stay informed with a reliable/trusted source of information as a part of social responsibility. This is often related to a propensity to overestimate risk in people with Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) [6]. This may increase sensitivity to pandemic threats and further destabilize patients and increase functional impairment. Social media is particularly fertile ground for anxiety-inducing information and disinformation. Perhaps a break from social media to mute the triggering things should be a necessity. Rather media can alleviate the problem of the public by presenting positive facts of corona virus cases.</p>

<h4>Fig1: Various Psychological stress associated with COVID-2019</h4>



<p>The human being is a social creature tends to express his concerns, escalation of fears, issues and issues with our friends and family and companions. The social help that we get from our companions, family and well-wishers assumes a huge job in easing pressure and improving our mental well-being. Social connectedness presents an extra layer of challenge as it is a protective factor against suicide risk. Thus, the concern for extended social isolation can have a&nbsp; greater risk for suicide.</p>



<p>The moments of quiet desperation might murder even the survival hopes. The long-term concern i.e. increased loss of livelihood/financial stress can further add to the compounding issue. We foresee the impacts of irresistible sickness dangers to show as sheer nervousness and panic: stress over getting  contamination, stress over friends and family getting sick, and stress when related side effects (even minor) are available [Figure 1]. The non-availability of a conclusive treatment effectively intensifies tension.</p>



<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus “It’s easy to blame, it’s easy to politicize, it’s harder to tackle a problem together and find solutions together”. We must Be assertive about standards of hygiene. Coronavirus is a stark reminder that we are not individuals, rather we rely upon one another and are interconnected. Engage in healthy distractions, for example, viewing an entertaining film, taking a stroll in the outside air, learning another dialect or skill. Societal support and empathy are required for affected individuals, and for the individuals who are working at the cutting edges. Health experts need stress management training to mitigate the aftermath. Online counseling/ Virtual interaction through e-resources could offer enthusiastic help. An increasingly stringent and uniformed approach is the way forward. A low index of suspicion of mental distress can help in early discovery and treatment.</p>
