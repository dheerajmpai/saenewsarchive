<p style="text-align:justify">&#8220;Meeting a challenge such as COVID-19 needs strong community participation and support. Self-help groups and dedicated NGOs are perfect vehicles in the current scenario for awareness creation, introducing relevant solutions, making and distributing the low tech items such as masks and disinfectants&#8221;, said Professor Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, DST.</p>
