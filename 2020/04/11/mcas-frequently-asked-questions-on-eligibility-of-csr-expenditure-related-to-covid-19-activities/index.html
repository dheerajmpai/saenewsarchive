<p style="text-align:justify">Payment of salary/ wages in normal circumstances is a contractual and statutory obligation of the company. Similarly, payment of salary/ wages to employees and workers even during the lockdown period is a moral obligation of the employers, as they have no alternative source of employment or livelihood during this period.

Hence, payment of wages to temporary or casual or daily wage workers during the lockdown period shall not count towards CSR expenditure.</p>
