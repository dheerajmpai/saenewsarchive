He urged people not to get caught in the trap of over-confidence and not harbor a feeling that if corona has not yet reached their city, village, street or office, it is not going to reach now. He stressed &#8216;Do Gaz doori hai zaroori&#8217; should be our mantra and people should maintain a distance of two yards and keep themselves healthy.
