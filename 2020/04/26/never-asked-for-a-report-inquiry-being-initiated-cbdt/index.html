<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">It is unequivocally stated that CBDT never asked IRS Association or these officers to prepare such a report.  No permission was sought by the officers before going public with their personal views and suggestions on official matters, which is a violation of extant Conduct Rules. Necessary inquiry is being initiated in this matter.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">It is reiterated that the impugned report does not reflect the official views of CBDT/Ministry of Finance in any manner.</span></span></p>
