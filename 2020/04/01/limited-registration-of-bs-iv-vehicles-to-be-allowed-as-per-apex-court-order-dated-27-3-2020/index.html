The Supreme Court has allowed limited and conditional sale and registration of  not more than 10 per cent pending BS-4 stock (as conveyed to the Apex Court) with vehicle dealers(except in Delhi, NCR),  within 10 days of lifting of the lockdown in a city following outbreak of Covid-19 in the country. The Apex Court has however maintained the stay on sale and registration of such vehicles in Delhi NCR.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As per orders of apex Court dated 24.10.2018, no BS-IV vehicle is to be sold or  registered with effect from 1.4.2020. Registration  of only BS-VI vehicles is permitted from today throughout India.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Bharat Stage (BS) emission norms are standards instituted by the government to regulate output of air pollutants from motor vehicles. The BS-IV norms have been enforced across the country since April 2017.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India has decided to switch to the world&#8221;s cleanest emissions standard from April 1 as it leapfrogs straight to Euro-VI emission standards from Euro-IV  now &#8212; a feat achieved in just three years and not seen in any of the large economies around the globe.</p>
