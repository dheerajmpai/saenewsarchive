<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>Automatic Mist Based Sanitiser Dispensing Unit</strong></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Centre for Fire Explosive &amp; Environment Safety (CFEES), Delhi along with HPO 1, using its expertise in mist technology for fire suppression, has developed automatic mist based sanitiser dispensing unit. It is a contactless sanitiser dispenser which sprays alcohol based hand rub sanitiser solution for sanitisation of hands while entering the buildings/office complexes, etc. It is based on water mist aerator technology, which was developed for water conservation.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">The unit operates without contact and is activated through an ultrasonic sensor. A single fluid nozzle with low flow rate is used to generate aerated mist to dispense the hand rub sanitiser. This sanitises the hands with minimum wastage. Using atomiser, only 5-6 ml sanitiser is released for 12 seconds in one operation and it gives the full cone spray over both palms so that disinfection operation of hands is complete.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">It is a very compact unit and bulk fill option makes it economical and long lasting product. It is easy to install system as wall-mountable or on a platform. As an indication of operation an LED illuminates the spray.          </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:black">The unit was manufactured with the help of M/s Riot Labz Pvt Ltd, Noida, and one unit has been installed at DRDO Bhawan. The unit can be used for </span>sanitisation of hands at <span style="color:black">entry and exit to hospitals, malls, office buildings, residential buildings,</span> airports, metro stations, railway stations, bus stations<span style="color:black"> and critical installations.</span> The product is also expected to be very useful for entry/ exit of isolation and quarantine centres.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>UV Sanitisation Box and Hand-held UV device</strong></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Defence Institute of Physiology &amp; Allied Sciences (DIPAS) and Institute of Nuclear Medicine &amp; Allied Sciences (INMAS), DRDO laboratories in Delhi have designed &amp; developed Ultraviolet C Light based sanitisation box and hand held UV-C (ultraviolet light with wavelength 254 nanometres) device. The UV-C consists of a shorter, more energetic wavelength of light. It is particularly good at destroying genetic material in COVID-19. The radiation warps the structure RNA which prevents the viral particles from making more copies of themselves.  The UV-C kills microbes quickly. Sanitisation of the items by employing UV-C light avoids the harmful effects of the chemicals used for the disinfection. This is environment friendly and is a contact free effective sanitisation method.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">The UV-C box is designed for disinfecting personal belongings like mobile phone, tablets, purse, currency, cover of office files, etc. COVID-19 virus will be deactivated by using UVC lamps in one minute placed equi-distantly in a box with UV dose of 100 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>. The UV lamps used in the sanitisation box also emits 185 nm which produces ozone and is able to take care of the unexposed area on the surfaces of the objects placed in the box.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">The hand held device having eight watt UV-C lamp disinfects office and house hold objects like chairs, files, postal delivered items and food packets with an exposure of 45 second at a 100 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>irradiance placed at a distance of less than two inches.  This measure can reduce the transmission of Coronavirus in office and public environment which is required to work in all conditions.</span></span></p>
