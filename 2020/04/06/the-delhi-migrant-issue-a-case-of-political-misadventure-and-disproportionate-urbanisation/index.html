<p>The ramifications of political rancor in current exigencies resulted in emotionally exhausting and traumatizing visuals in Delhi. Thousands of people gathered to grab any mode of transport to travel back to their native towns.  This incident allegedly occurred based on a rumor that the respective state governments have aligned buses to carry back migrant workers to their native states. A big media house was also found misreporting on the issues. To add fuel to the fire electricity and water supply of poor migrants were cut and videos came out of announcements being made in dark about buses lined up to carry people home. This led to agonizingly catastrophic visuals of people hoarding the bus stand hungry and thirsty.  There are two questions that arise out of the situation. One is why for political gains anyone should allow thousands to suffer and the second is why we have an inter-state migrant issue in the country. Let’s answer each one by one.</p>



<p>The answer to the first question is directly linked to the image of the Prime Minister and his growing popularity in current times. This has raised alarm bells in the opposite camp. The Prime Minister’s ability to use situations of adversity to bridge the divide between people and enhance his cult following has decimated the opposition’s agenda on many fronts. So what’s the best way to tarnish the image?? The answer is Chaos. Chaos followed by a narrative of an ill planned shutdown. Arguments were raised that shutting down the country within a matter of four hours was ill planned and it had directly led to the migrant situation in Delhi. Soon sold out media stooges started tweeting on the same lines and a concerted effort of pushing the narrative was on full display. Set people with predefined articles, news bulletin, blogs and videos started flooding the internet. But how far is the argument of an ill planned shutdown true? Let’s understand the sequence of events. Almost a week before 22nd March, the day of ‘Junta Curfew’ (first voluntary people lockdown call), most of the Corporates were asked to provide work from home for their employees. Even before the ‘Junta Curfew’ on 22nd March a four day period was given to make people understand the gravity of the situation. A disciplined observation of the 22nd March call was achieved. Calls were later made by different state governments to the people to voluntarily remain indoors even after 22nd March and only step out in case of an emergency. However, the recalcitrant approach of the people to the various state and central government orders was evident. In the meanwhile, there was an imminent danger of stepping into Stage 3 of the Corona Virus spread. Finally on 24th March a nationwide lockdown was called upon by the Prime Minister. So in context almost 10 day period was given to people to make them understand of the imminent call for shutdown. Also during the period a lot of information was spread on how the Covid-19 Virus spreads and how shutting down was the only solution. The experience of different nations about shutting down was also clearly highlighted as a remedy to the Corona Virus spread. So, this argument of ill planned shutdown falls flat on its face.  The entire agenda was to promote disharmony through rumors and miscommunication. The motive was also to push the narrative to the International Diasporas and paint a picture of misgovernance.  The subversive plot was carefully planned and executed. Today the issue is majorly resolved. However, the situation commands for major governance and policy introspection. One such policy is the policy of Urbanisation. Let’s answer it through the second question of the issue of inter-state migrant in the country.</p>



<p>The issue of urbanization will be the biggest issue that the nation will face in the coming decade. The urban-rural divide in India has led to a major issue of the inter-state migration. With the economic activity restricted to urban centers and the diminishing economic feasibility of commercial farming, the rural population is not left with a choice but to migrate to urban lands for sustenance and livelihood. According to the reports every minute 25-30 people migrate from rural to urban areas. Furthermore, according to the 2011 census close to 450 million people migrated from rural to urban area. The rate is doubling with every decade. The impact of this can be seen in metropolitans like Delhi. This is especially due to the lack of employment urban centers in populated states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar which have a combined population of almost 300 Million. For example, the level of urbanization in Uttar Pradesh is 22.28% which is way less than the national average of 31.16%. Also the growth of Urbanisation of Bihar is just 11.3 % according to the 2011 Census. This poor rate can be attributed to the failure of successive governments. However, looking forward this issue has opened up an opportunity of creating Tier I, Tier II and Tier III urbanized centers with proper infrastructure and resources to sustain the migrating population. It also allows for decentralization of economic activities from few metros and cosmos to a number of urbanized centers in each state. This can cater to the economic mobility and sustenance of the population. It is of primary importance to understand the seriousness of the issue as it can create chaos again in the very near future for political gains. This is more so because of the predicted figures of the Indian urban population likely to reach 600 million by 2030.</p>



<p>Thus, looking at the overall scenario it is very important to understand the current challenges that we as a population are facing on both political and infrastructural front. It is important to avoid falling prey to political narratives. Also, the issue of urbanization needs to be taken up seriously by the state governments to prevent such situations from happening in the future.</p>
