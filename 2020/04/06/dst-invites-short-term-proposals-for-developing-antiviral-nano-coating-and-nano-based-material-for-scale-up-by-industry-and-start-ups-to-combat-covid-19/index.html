Such Nano coatings could contribute immensely in the emerging health care requirements in India’s fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. This call is for bringing the Academic groups and relevant Industrial Groups together for submitting proposals to DST’s Nano Mission.It encourages multidisciplinary efforts and collaboration with industrial partners for scaling up production within a year.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The invitation calls for development of Antiviral Nano-coatings for producing anti-COVID-19 Triple Layer Medical masks and N-95 respirator or better masks in large quantities and PPEs for safeguarding health care workers against COVID-19. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The industry contribution could include either manpower support, or support partly for testing of nano-coating to meet the EU or US standards. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The proposals will be screened for suitability and scope followed by a peer-review on a first come first evaluation basis. The items developed and transferred to industry will need to meet the International standards and may facilitate development of appropriate Indian Standards too for ensuring quality of the nano-coating based product. The last date for submission of proposals is April 30, 2020.</p>
