The neighbourhood Post Office is providing its services to the society and trying to supplement the efforts of the state/local administration to reach out to the masses to fulfil their financial, health care and welfare needs in these challenging times of Covid-19.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Post offices across J&#038;K and Ladakh UTs are being opened with the primary objective of facilitating financial transactions- easy withdrawals and deposits of funds so that the people can have sufficient cash flow to fulfil their day to day requirements of basic needs. In this regard, Aadhaar enabled Payment System (AePS) has also been enabled at the post offices so that the people having bank account with any bank can withdraw upto Rs 10000/- per month from any Post office. The only condition is that the bank account must be linked with the Aadhaar of the beneficiary.</p>
