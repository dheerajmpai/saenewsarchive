<p>During the current COVID-19 pandemic, RSS&#8217;s Seva on the ground is in full force. This is not the case only with the COVID-19 pandemic but during all other times of calamities RSS&#8217;s volunteers are the first ones to be on the ground. Rashtriya SwayamSevak Sangh aka RSS like a big tree has not only established their roots of Seva work in India but is increasing day-by-day in other parts of the world too.</p>



<p>On such unit of RSS i.e. RSS&#8217;s Mumbai unit has been on the ground for long in these pandemic times, <a href="http://13.235.0.46/2020/04/12/rsss-mumbai-unit-emerges-as-rescuers-for-the-ne-christians-muslims-and-transgender-indians/">daily 100000+ food packets are being distributed</a>, not just food but even at the Bhag level (district) of RSS structure there have been packing centers through which 28000+ grocery kits were distributed to homes.</p>



<p>Due to this stronghold on the ground and wide reach outside India, RSS&#8217;s Mumbai unit got a call for help from an Indian in the U.S. The following encounter narrated by RSS&#8217;s volunteer from Vileparle to the SAE news is the testimony to the fact.</p>



<p>&#8220;An 85-year old man stayed alone in Mumbai and his daughter who resides in the USA couldn&#8217;t help him physically due to the coronavirus pandemic. To take care of the 85-year old man a paid nurse was kept on duty and for the need of food a tiffin system was arranged by his daughter. Due to lockdown the tiffin system and the nurse couldn&#8217;t reach the old man&#8217;s home. Hence, the daughter called upon RSS volunteer in the US for help. RSS volunteers assured her that her father would be contacted. The Swayamsevak from the US then called upon my swayamsevak friend named Aditya in Nagpur and then Aditya called upon me and presented the situation. I assured them of all possible help. The time was of 11:45 pm at night and I didn&#8217;t know how to find a contact in Vileparle. Suddenly, I remembered that a Swayaymsevak from Vileparle was staying in Germany and the time was 7:15 pm in Germany. Hence, I called him on Whatsapp and asked for any contact in Vilerparle and spoke about the situation as well. He gave me the contact of Sahakaryawaha (Joint general secretary) in Vileparle Shri. Jayesh Shah and I asked him to notify through Whatsapp message so that I can talk to him in the early morning. To my surprise, I got the call from Jayesh Shah in which he said that one of our Swayamsevak who stayed near the old man&#8217;s apartment had already reached the location and the needy was helped.</p>



<p>Hence, the call which started from the US, en route to Nagpur, then to Germany and finally to the Vileparle was successful in reaching out to the 85-year old man.&#8221;  </p>
