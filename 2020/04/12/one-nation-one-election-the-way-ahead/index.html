<p>
The
concept of One Nation One Election (<em>hereinafter,
</em>ONOE)
is not something discussed in India exclusively. Countries like
Sweden, South Africa, and Belgium etc. have been contesting elections
from the very beginning using this policy. To prevent costly and
time-consuming elections, the very idea of having ONOE in India has
been mooted by our Hon’ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>



<p> This concept of “One Nation, One Election” means conducting the Lok Sabha and the state assemblies’ elections together and this excludes elections to panchayats and state municipalities as well as by-elections.<strong>[1] </strong>Elections will be held only once in five years – either in a single phase, or more practically, in multiple phases. For instance, if we take a small example considering the state of Tamil Nadu if ONOE is implemented, voters in Tamil Nadu, for instance, will vote for the central government and the state government at the same time, perhaps in 2023.<strong> [2]</strong></p>



<p> <strong>THE ONOE PROPOSAL</strong></p>



<p>
The
impetus for ONOE primarily came from our honest PM Narendra Modi in
2016 as stated above. Taking it one step forward, NITI Aayog has
already provided its assistance in favor of ONOE in its debate
document. The Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on
Personnel, Public Grievance, Law and Justice (Parliamentary
Committee) in its 79th Report<strong>
[3]</strong>
(2015) has also favored simultaneous elections. The reason provided
for the same in both the expert findings are primarily that the
country&#8217;s financial spending will be reduced during the course of
distinct elections, and the otherwise frequent application of the
Model Code of Conduct (MCC) which leads to political paralysis and
government discrepancy, disruption of public lives and deferment of
vital facilities, and the accessibility of resources shall be
cured.<strong>[4]</strong></p>



<p> India&#8217;s Law Commission was requested to report on simultaneous elections and their viability in 2017. On 30 August 2018, the Commission presented its draft document endorsing the proposition and was fully supported by ONOE-but it also suggested changes to the Constitutional provisions, statutes, and some other regulations.</p>



<h4>
<strong>BACKGROUND
CHECK</strong></h4>



<p>
For
the last couple of years, the idea of ONOE has been doing rounds. In
fact, this is not that for the first time, the idea is being
discussed in India. Elections were being simultaneously held in 1952,
1957, 1962 and 1967 in India. For certain purposes, the practice of
simultaneous election was broken in the years of 1968-1969 owing to
the premature dissolution of certain legislative assemblies.  From
that moment on, India has been making attempts to adopt the old
election system but there is no consensus amongst the political
parties.</p>



<p>The
RSS-BJP combine revived the discussion in the early 1990s as the BJP
gained prominence in elections and Atal Bihari Vajpayee established
three governments, including one of 13 days. A vocal proponent of
simultaneous elections was BJP veteran LK Advani. In 1999, during the
rule of Vajpayee, the Law Commission study suggested that elections
be held for the Lok Sabha and state assemblies. The law commission
had suggested that if a motion of no confidence is moved against a
government, it should also have an alternative vote confidence
resolution government.<strong>

<h4> ONE NATION<strong> ONE ELECTION: A BOON OR BANE?</strong></h4>



<p>
Simultaneous
elections have both advantages as well as disadvantages. It is
important to study both aspects as it helps in a better evaluation of
the impact of the policy.  India has been known as a country with
unity in diversity, having a population of around 1.3 billion and
being the most culturally diverse nation, a major change in the
method of conducting elections for a democracy like India can really
have a negative impact on it.</p>



<p>
With
no guarantee of reduced expenditure of political parties, critics
argue that ONOE might lessen the importance of state elections thus
affecting the very federal nature of the Country. Many Politicians
are <em>per
se</em>
against the very concept of simultaneous elections, which in their
view endangers the democratic credentials of India.<strong>[6]</strong></p>



<p> Elections for the Centre and the state at the same time will not only hinder every aspect of life in that particular period but laying down the procedure for simultaneous elections in itself is a very tedious task. The government would have to amend various provisions in the Constitution for laying down the procedure which is a very intense and lengthy task.</p>



<p>
Moreover,
a significantly large number of security personnel will be required
at the same time during the elections which can turn out to be a very
demanding and challenging task.</p>



<p>
One
election might be way ahead in the Country but they certainly have
their own advantages. The benefits are clear not just because the
reports suggest but other countries following the same model of
holding elections are having a successful time.</p>



<p>
It
is easily observed that every now and then elections are an unending
process in one or the other state of India. The state administration
and Election Commission of India make huge efforts in conducting
elections every now and then. The general election of Lok Sabha and
State Assemblies are held at a span of 5 years. In addition to that,
some state assemblies’ elections are held separately which in
return put a massive burden on the country’s economy.</p>



<p>
The
whole idea of reducing the cost of elections is to allocate the money
to other welfare and development purposes such as the funds saved
could be put to better use in strengthening the economy, defense,
women empowerment, poverty alleviation, education, farmers and a host
of other beneficial measures.</p>



<p>
In
fact, facing the electorate more than once every five years increases
the accountability of leaders and keeps them on their feet, creating
numerous employments during elections, boosting the economy at the
grassroots level, it will also increase the policy-making of the
governments as it will save ample of time.</p>



<p> Whatever the advantages may be, one cannot deny that this process may lead to similar parties leading the state and center which will ultimately lead to monopoly. Similar things occurred in the 1952, 1957 and 1962 elections. It generates an issue when most of the electorate in the state want to elect a representative of that party that has no chance of coming to the center. Thus, at that moment, the elector will not offer that applicant the ballot while voting for that group that has the opportunity to join the union. Thus, there will not be fair voting and it will harm the soul of democracy and the situation will be just like a one-party rule in the whole nation and there will be no opposition to any action</p>



<h4>
<strong>ONOE
AND THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA</strong></h4>



<p> While discussing <strong>Article 289</strong> of the Draft Constitution, Prof. Shibban Lal Saksena stated, “Our Constitution does not provide for a fixed four years election cycle like the one in the United States of America. The elections will probably be almost always going on in some province or the other &#8230; It may not be so in the very beginning or in the very first five or ten years. But after ten or twelve years, at every moment some election in some province will be going on. … in our Constitution all the elections will not synchronize but they will be at varying times in accordance with the vote of no-confidence passed in various Legislatures and the consequent dissolution of the Legislatures.”<strong> [7] </strong> </p>



<p>
The
policy of ONOE is not as feasible as it seems. Moreover, there would
be some major changes in our Constitution of India without which the
agenda of ONOE cannot be implemented. <strong>Article
83</strong>
which deals with the duration of Houses of Parliament r/w <em><strong>Article
172</strong></em>
related to the duration of the state legislatures, which ensures five
years to every elected Lok Sabha and assembly, the words “unless
sooner dissolved” need to be amended.</p>



<p>
Similarly,
<strong>Article
85(1)</strong>
deals dissolution of Lok Sabha by the President r/w <em><strong>Article
174(1)</strong></em>
related to the dissolution of state assemblies, which will have to be
amended accordingly because if ONOE takes place there are chances
that a government may fall due to no-confidence motion.<strong>[8]</strong>
Lastly, if we look at <strong>Article
356</strong>
which deals with a President’s Rule in the state may alter the
basic structure of the constitution as it only comes into force when
there is serious damage to the constitutional machinery of the state.
Also, the <strong>Tenth
Schedule</strong>
of the Constitution in regards to the anti-defection law will have to
be reconsidered as well. 
</p>



<p>
Critics
also argue that ONOE is against the federal structure of the
Constitution. It imposes the burden on voters to think of national
and states issues at the same platform, and tries to take away the
name made by the regional parties over the course of time.
Furthermore, it is difficult to compare India to countries like
Sweden, Belgium, and South Africa because every state has different
mechanisms and principles on which their election machinery works.</p>



<h4> CONCLUSION</h4>



<p> “It is undeniable that simultaneous elections are a far-reaching electoral reform. If it is to be enacted, a strong political consensus is needed and it should be supplemented by an agenda of extensive electoral reforms. The pros and cons must be properly evaluated and practical options are taken seriously,” Mr. Quraishi concludes in his article on Simultaneous elections.[9] But, no matter how farfetched this idea appears, it&#8217;s time to believe beyond the borders and traditional boundaries and attempt to comprehend the consequences of ONOE and then make a move in that direction.</p>
