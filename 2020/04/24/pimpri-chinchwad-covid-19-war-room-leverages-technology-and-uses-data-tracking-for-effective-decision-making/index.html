Under Smart Cities Mission, technology solutions have been adopted at war room for collecting, collating and analysing data to generate actionable insights and aid in prompt decision making. Following dashboards are in operation at the war room:</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif">Healthcare and Patient Tracking Dashboard: PCMC has developed a dashboard which provides real-time information on COVID related cases, testing and healthcare arrangements. Each hospital has been provided access to the dashboard via a dedicated online form wherein, the information is filled by each of the hospital unit which gets updated on real-time basis on the dashboard at ICCC. This dashboard tracks data from 10 hospitals providing COVID treatment to provide regular updates on parameters such as &#8211; bed capacity, sample testing, positive and quarantine cases.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
<span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif">COVID-19 GIS Dashboard: This is a location-based information system used to geotag &#8211; people who are home quarantined (purple colour dots on map), last location of COVID-19 positive persons (Red Drop Marks), Area Cordoning (Black lines), Lane closure, etc.. Once a patient is found to be COVID-19 positive, his/her last location of stay is marked on the dashboard. Similarly, all home quarantined persons are marked on the map. This information is used to generate a heat map which helps classify areas from low risk to high risk. This dashboard is also used to identify epicentres of COVID-19 cases which helps the Health Department to identify locations for immediate spraying of disinfectants. The same information is used by the Medical Department to send out special Task Forces for carrying out door to door campaigns and identify if there are more cases. This geographical information assists in identifying the areas for condoning-off to contain any further spread. The GIS Dashboard and City Surveillance Dashboard has pan city reach.</span></span></p>

Additional similar interventions are being explored and will be implemented subsequently.</span></span></p>
