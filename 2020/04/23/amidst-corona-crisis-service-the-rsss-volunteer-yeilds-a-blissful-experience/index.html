<p>Due to the disaster of Coronavirus, various types of service works have been started in Mumbai on behalf of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh Janakalyan Samiti (Maharashtra Province). Under this, the vehicle facility has also been provided for the treatment of patients at the concerned hospital. During the service on the ground, several overwhelming responses of RSS volunteers have been recorded which were Godly in nature. One such experience narrated by RSS&#8217;s volunteer adds more weight to the fact.  </p>



<p>Explaining his experience, a volunteer in the service of patients said that, &#8220;In the past, I got a call from Mrs. Snehalta Ramakrishna at 10.30 in the morning. &#8216;I have to go to Jaslok Hospital at 5 pm. You would have to come to my house in Matunga to pick me up and after leaving the hospital and after checkup and treatment I have to come back to the house again, will you be able to do it?&#8217; she said. The day before, I had received a call from Mr. Ankush Betkar, the Vibhag Karyavaha, in which he had called me for a discussion regarding the service work. So I was aware that his call could come anytime and I had to go anytime. Despite this my sensitive mind said to leave all the work and help them first and I did just that. I agreed to take and bring them back from the hospital. An hour later I got her call again and she said we have to leave at 3 pm in the afternoon, the doctor has asked to come early. So I took the car and reached his house at 1.30 am. As soon as I got in the car, Madam started talking to me immediately. Madame&#8217;s age seemed to be close to 70 years. We both started having conversations and were getting acquainted with each other. She said that her daughter lives in Singapore. On reaching the hospital, it was learned that the doctors would come a little late. After a while the doctor came and Madam completed her entire procedure. Madam introduced me to everyone as a <em>Devdoot</em> and thanked me and gave me a lot of love and blessings. Then I left her at home, as soon as she got out of the car, she thanked me and invited cum took a promised from me to come with my family next time. She introduced me as her son to a man which I met near her house. This introduction was really overwhelming. I also took a selfie with her. Madam urged me to come home again then I promised her that I will definitely come with my wife next time.</p>



<p>While doing service work through RSS Janakalyan Samiti, we get to experience many such beautiful experiences many times. That is why I feel the bliss while doing service work.&#8221;</p>



<p>Indeed Swami Vivekananda rightly noted that, &#8216;Desire nothing for yourself. Do all for others. This is to live and move and have your being in God&#8217;</p>
