<p class="has-text-align-justify">Amidst the corona crisis, the yeoman service of RSS and the RSS inspired organizations has reached around crores of individuals and lakhs of families. The strong ground network of RSS not just in India but in Germany, the US, and other international countries has resulted in reaching out to the needy in different parts of the world. In another remarkable event RSS&#8217;s network reached in the African continent to help out an Indian stuck in the Nigerian country.</p>



<p>One of Swayamsevaks friend is currently residing in Nigeria for two years. He has been admitted in a hospital for nearly 25 days on being identified as Corona &#8216;positive&#8217;. However, although being positive, unlike the initial stages his health condition is now stable. </p>



<p>In a far country like Nigeria where it is quite impossible to find an Indian community in large numbers, the RSS Syaymsevak ensured that the individual could get his basic meal and the other healthy nutritious items which would increase his immunity power. The individual shared a heartful message and asked the Swayamsevak to circulate it maximum within the RSS circles.</p>



<p>&#8220;1. I have the full support of RSS here. RSS&#8217;s Swayamsevak sends me the entire meal. I have never seen this Swayamsevak before however, despite that he has made necessary arrangements for me. Also, he ensured me that after recovery I can stay at his home until I get back to India. If I stay alive, I would say without any hesitation that the RSS had a big role to save my life.</p>



<p>2. Please convey this message to Shri. Mohan Bhagwat that if I stay alive I would definitely join RSS. </p>



<p>No one is ready to come near me here. I&#8217;ve been served like a dog, my food plate is kept at ten meters away from me. They don&#8217;t give me any medicine as there is no cure for this disease. You can&#8217;t eat African food here. In the place where you can&#8217;t find an Indian meal, this RSS worker who lives here alone sends me a new meal every day. Along with food, to improve the will power he sends me turmeric milk, basil extract, lemon syrup, ginger juice, Patanjali honey which will benefit me and boost my immunity. The RSS chain here is working so dedicatedly that I can get the right amount of these things in time. Due to the corona crisis, many Indians have fallen ill in hospitals in different cities and unfortunately many died. The RSS volunteers are fully aware of the risks involved however, without caring for their own lives and their families they are working hard to get the remaining Indian patients out of the country and send them back to the motherland. RSS&#8217;s service serves no profit for an individual or the organization despite that they are relentlessly working for the Indians here. On the contrary, there is a constant fear of being affected by the virus on oneself and one&#8217;s family. In such a case, the RSS man, whom I do not know, is taking the responsibility because he gets my information and orders from the organization.</p>



<p>This is what you call as an &#8216;Organization&#8217;, &#8216;Selfless Work&#8217;, &#8216;Love for the Motherland&#8217;</p>



<p>The work done by NGOs like the RSS in a foreign country like Nigeria is far more than appreciation. And most importantly, they don&#8217;t do it for appreciation or self-boasting.</p>



<p>Please share this experience and thoughts with all your volunteers.&#8221;</p>
