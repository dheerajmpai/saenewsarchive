The kiosk ensures protection to the sample collecting doctor &amp; prevents wastage of personal protection equipment (PPE). This initiative is a major step by Agartala in the fight against Covid-19.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left:6.0pt; margin-right:5.75pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Mounting of the kiosk on three wheeler vehicle enables it to navigate through narrow lanes &amp; helps collection of samples from community itself. There is no need for patients to come to hospital for giving sample. The kiosk also facilitates mass testing of larger number of people in a shorter timeframe. This initiative was taken by the Municipal Commissioner, Agartala Municipal Corporation, who is also the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Agartala Smart City Limited.</span></span></p>
