<p style="text-align:justify">This exhibition brings Cha-Chai, a wrought-iron sculpture shaped as a teapot, by the renowned artist, Joana Vasconcelos. The ‘Tea Pot’ and its iron railings represent the bridge between urban and rural landscape.  The aroma of tea, as depicted by the installation, takes visitors to a memorable journey from this physical world to a surreal world. Century old, long lasting connection between Portugal and India shines through tea or chai.  The Portuguese adopted chá (Sha) as their word for it, incredibly close to the Indian chai. </p>
