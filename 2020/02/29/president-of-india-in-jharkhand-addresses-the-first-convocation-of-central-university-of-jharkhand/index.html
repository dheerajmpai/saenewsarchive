<p style="text-align:justify">Speaking on the occasion, the President said that understanding the importance of social service is necessary not only for nation-building but also for self-determination. Everyone should be prepared to repay the debt of society. The entire society contributes in the establishment and operation of a university. Therefore, universities should also fulfil their responsibilities towards the society. He said that students can spend some time in nearby villages and help villagers solve their problems and try to improve their quality of life. They can make aware villagers about various welfare initiatives of government. He was happy to note that the University has taken the initiative to adopt five nearby villages and has also taken the responsibility of teaching rural children. He said that many such programs can be run for the people who are relatively left behind in the society.</p>
