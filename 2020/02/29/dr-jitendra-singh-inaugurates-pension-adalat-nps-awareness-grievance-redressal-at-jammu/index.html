The Programme is being conducted by the Department of Pension &#038; Pensioners’ Welfare, Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Government of India. The Minister also launched “Do You Know” Twitter Series on Family Pension, along with a booklet highlighting case studies with interpretation of Pension Rules.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Inaugurating the Pension Adalat, Dr.Jitendra Singh said that this is the first time that Pension Adalat is being conducted outside Delhi as the government wants to reach every part of society, every part of country to get the pensioner’s grievances redressed in the real-time as aspired by the honourable Prime Minister of India. The Minister further said that the Pension Adalats will help in on-the-spot redressal of pensioners’ grievances which has given the right of “Ease of Living” to the pensioners. Dr.Jitendra Singh also said that the Prime Minster Shri Narendra Modi has directed that Pensioners be provided a hassle-free administrative system to resolve their grievances.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Speaking about the grievance redressal system, the Minister said that the grievance redressal system was quite neglected before 2014 but the day the present government has taken to power, the system has completely changed. The grievances have increased manifold from two lakhs to twenty lakhs which is evidence that the people have a complete faith on the present government, the Minister added. The present government has a grievance redressal rate from 95 percent to 100 percent per week and the pension Adalat started a few years back is proof of it, he reiterated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Minister also said that a number of reforms have been undertaken by the Government to facilitate the pensioners. Highlighting the initiatives of the present Government, he said that one of the main initiatives taken was to fix the minimum pension at Rs 1,000. He said that other initiatives such as Bhavishya, Sankalp, JeevanPraman-digital life certificates, doing away with the obsolete laws and self-attestation, among others have also been taken. He further said that the retired population is increasing in India and it is in national interest to channelize their energies in a positive manner as this government takes them as an asset and not as a liability. There should be smooth transition from their active life to retired life, he added.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Minister also said that the real time portal, the dash board for the security personnel’s and a toll free number 1800111960 started by the government is the proof that the present government is serious towards the welfare of the employees both serving, retiring and the retired.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The government under Shri Narendra Modi performs with evidence and all the central schemes and programmes have been implemented in a very progressive manner in J&#038;K like in other parts of India and the success stories of people are before you who got benefited under UjjawalaYojana and Saubhagya Scheme.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In his address, the Advisor to the Lt. Governor of Jammu and Kashmir, Shri. R.R. Bhatnagar said that it is good to see that this pension Adalat is conducted outside Delhi for the first time which shows the seriousness of the central government towards the grievance redressal mechanism. It is a good opportunity for the pensioners, the retiring employees and the serving to get their grievances redressed here by asking all the relevant questions, he added. Praising the central government for many of its initiatives taken in the last three years, the Advisor said that the pendency of the pension related cases has come down significantly which is a sign of a good governance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Secretary, Department of Pension &#038; Pensioners’ Welfare, Dr.KshatrapatiShivaji, in his welcome address, said that the aim of the Department is to provide a social security and a distinguished social life to the pensioners post-retirement. He further said that those who are not able to have a life certificate for many of the reasons, the government has eased this route by asking the banks to come to their home and issue a life certificate. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Pension Adalats are being convened with the objective of bringing on a common table the aggrieved pensioner, the concerned department, the bank or CGHS representative, wherever relevant, so that such cases can be settled across the table within the framework of extant rules.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In the Pension Adalat, 342 cases pertaining to Central government pensioners of various departments and Ministries like Textiles, Defence, Forests, ASI, GSI,CGWB, CWC, C&#038;AG, NSSO, DGDD, BSF, SSB, CISF, CRPF, ITBP, MIB and JKGAD were discussed and subsequently 289 such cases were settled on spot. The 53 pending cases were asked to be processed and settled within 15 days by the concerned departments.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">With respect to NPS subscribers, cases pertaining to Central Government Employees, as well as those of the UT of Jammu &#038; Kashmir (J&#038;K), numbering more than 200, whose NPS accounts have certain irregularity, were taken up and their respective Pr. AOs and DDOs were called for a briefing and corrective action, so that the subscribers do not suffer continuous loss, resulting in lower annuity value, post their retirement.</p>
