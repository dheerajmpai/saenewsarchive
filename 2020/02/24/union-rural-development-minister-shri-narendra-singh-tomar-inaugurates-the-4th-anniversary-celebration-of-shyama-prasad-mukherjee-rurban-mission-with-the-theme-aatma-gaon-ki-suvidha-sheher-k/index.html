Shri Tomar said that the community perspective has to be kept in mind for holistic development of a region and cluster approach is very fruitful in that regard. The Minister urged that people should be dedicated towards achieving the objective of ‘sabka saath sabka vikas’ and work towards development of villages and rural India with a community spirit. He said that when the community spirit and effort increases then Centre and State will work together for development of clusters and all schemes will be made convergent towards that objective.</p>
