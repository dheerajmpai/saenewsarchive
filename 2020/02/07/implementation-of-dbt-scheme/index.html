Identified area is defined under the Rules as State or Union Territory or any specified area within the State or Union Territory for which there is a written consent of the State Government for implementation of the scheme. It is therefore optional for the States/UTs to implement the cash transfer of food subsidy scheme or continue with distribution of foodgrains as per provisions of NFSA through fair price shops.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The cash transfer of food subsidy scheme is being implemented in Union Territories of Chandigarh, Puducherry and urban areas of Dadra and Nagar Haveli.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Cash Transfer of Food Subsidy Rules, 2015 have been notified under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013. NFSA does not have any provision for distribution of free rice. Therefore, question of exemption of free rice scheme under NFSA does not arise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">No report of woes of female members of the family against misuse of cash under DBT (cash) scheme has been received from any of the 3 UTs where DBT (cash) is being implemented. Further, the decision to implement cash transfer of food subsidy scheme or continue with distribution of foodgrains through Fair Price Shops under NFSA rests with the State Government / UT Administration.</p>
