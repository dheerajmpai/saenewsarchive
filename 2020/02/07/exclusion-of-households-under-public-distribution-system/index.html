NFSA provides coverage for about 81.35 Crore persons as per Census 2011. Presently, no proposal is under consideration of Department to revise the provisions of the Act.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">            Further, as per the TPDS (Control) Order, 2015 for implementation of Act, State/UT Governments are required to review the lists of ration cards/beneficiaries’ details every year for the purpose of periodic updation of the same to include eligible families/beneficiaries and exclude the ineligible ration cards/beneficiaries, if any. As such this exercise of deletion of ineligible/ duplicate ration cards/beneficiaries and inclusion of eligible beneficiaries therein is a continuous process.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">            As per TPDS (Control) Order 2015, compilation of deleted ration cards is started at the end of year. A Statement showing State/UT-wise details of deleted ration cards, including Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) ration cards, during last two years, excluding current year, is annexed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">            Of late, a few reports have appeared in the media highlighting deaths across the country citing difficulties faced by the beneficiaries under NFSA in receiving their entitled quota of foodgrains. However, as informed by the concerned State/UT Governments from time to time, the allegations made in the media reports of deaths due to starvation have not been substantiated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">            Further, this Department has issued the instructions to all States/UTs that no eligible beneficiary/household shall be denied from subsidized foodgrains under NFSA and any suspected ineligible/duplicate ration card/beneficiary shall only be deleted after proper field verification by concerned State/UT.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This information was given in a written reply by the Minister of State for Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food &#038; Public Distribution Shri Danve Raosaheb Dadarao in Rajya Sabha today.</p>
