<p style="text-align:justify">New approach to meet aspirations of Northeast</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Prime Minister said that the Government had adopted a new approach to deal with various issues plaguing the North East.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He said such an approach was possible only after a deep understanding of the aspirations and the emotional issues of the region. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“The solutions were found through deliberations and discussions with all concerned and with empathy. They were found as we dealt with everyone as our own and not as outsiders. We conversed with them and made them feel one of our own. This has helped reduced extremism. Earlier, there were about 1000 killings in the North-East due to extremism but today, on the whole,  the situation is normal and peaceful. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">North East is the Growth Engine of the country</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“Over 3 thousand kilometers of roads have been built in the North East in the last three-four years. New national highways have been approved. The entire North East rail network has been converted into broad gauge.There is also a focus on strengthening the youth of the Northeast with new institutions of education, skill and sports. Apart from this, new hostels have also been created for students of North East in Delhi and Bangalore”, Prime Minister added.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Prime Minister said that infrastructure doesnot mean a combination of mortar and cement. It has a human side to it. It makes people feel that someone cares for them.  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“When lakhs of people get connectivity due to the completion of many projects hanging for decades like Bogibeel bridge, then their confidence in the government increases. This all-round development has played a very big role in turning separation into attachment. When there is attachment, when progress starts reaching out to everyone equally, people also get ready to work together. When people get ready to work together, even the biggest issues are resolved”, Prime Minister added.</p>
