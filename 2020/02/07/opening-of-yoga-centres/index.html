However, Central Government is implementing Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National AYUSH Mission (NAM) in the country under which financial assistance of Rs. 6.00 lakhs per unit (Rs. 0.6 Lakhs as one time assistance for initial furnishing and recurring assistance of Rs.5.4 Lakhs for manpower, maintenance etc.) is provided to States/UTs for setting up of Yoga Wellness Centre.
