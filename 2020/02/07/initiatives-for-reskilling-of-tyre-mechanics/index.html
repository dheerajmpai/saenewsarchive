In order to bring class rooms to the Tyre Fitter shops under its Project SAAMARTH, RSDC sends its Mobile Skill Vans to reach out to the workforce employed in Tyre services and maintenance. These vans move across different state highways, villages and towns, creating awareness about skill requirement for tyre service and maintenance and safety on roads associated with upkeep of the tyres. These vans are fitted with necessary equipment and manned by skilled personnel, to train tyre fitters, assess them on skills acquired and also certify them. Further, the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship has approved to scale up re-skilling of one million workforces in Rubber Sector through Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) Certification under SAMMARTH which provides for orientation programme followed by assessment of trainees enrolled in the Programme in three sub-sectors i.e (i) Tyre Service and Maintenance,Â  (ii) Manufacturing and (iii) Natural Rubber Plantation.</p>
