<p style="text-align:justify">At present, BISAG is a state agency of Department of Science and Technology Government of Gujarat, located at Gandhinagar, Gujarat.  It is registered as a Society and Trust with the Charity Commissioner of Ahmedabad.  Its Governing body is chaired by the Chief Secretary, Government of Gujarat.  Its charter is based on the philosophy that modern day planning for a holistic development calls for transparent, efficient and low-cost decision-making systems.  This involves multi-disciplinary information that encourages people’s participation and ensures equitable development. The application of space technologies (especially the space based remote sensing technology), satellite communication and geo-informatics has contributed significantly towards the socio-economic development.</p>
