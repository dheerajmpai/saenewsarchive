<p style="text-align:justify">The Minister said a large number of pedestrians, cyclists and motorised two-wheelers compete for space on roads, therefore, the road safety requirements of these vulnerable sections needs to be kept in mind while designing and developing transport strategies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Minister pointed out that India is the largest producer of Two wheelers and amongst largest manufacturer of Cars in the world.  Road accidents constitute the most important public health concern in the country; there were 1,51,417 road fatalities in over 4,67,044 road accidents in 2018 alone. 11 percent of deaths due to road accident of the world take place in India alone.  When translated into economic terms, estimates suggest that this has adversely affected our GDP by as much as 2-3% per annum.
