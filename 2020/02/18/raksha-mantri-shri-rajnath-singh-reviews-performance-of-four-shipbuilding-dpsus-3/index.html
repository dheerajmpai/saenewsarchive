Till date, the shipyard has exported 36 vessels and a Damage Control Simulator to friendly foreign countries. These projects were delivered ahead of schedule. The Company’s superior quality ships received accolades at the highest levels. Its dominance in exports is evident from 15 overseas deliveries made in the last four years including two large Offshore Petrol Vessels to Sri Lanka, Mauritius and Myanmar. The GSL has also got into understandings with various organisations as part of expanding its operations and scope. MoUs have been signed with NBCC in the field of Project Management Consultancy, with L&#038;T to jointly produce Defence Equipment for both domestic as well as export market, with BEL in the field of Composites and exports of Defence Products. </p>

It is the only shipyard capable of building destroyers and conventional submarines. INS Kolkata, INS Kochi, INS Chennai, INS Kalvari, INS Khanderi and others have been delivered by MDL in the last five years. In order to give an impetus to the ‘Make in India’ campaign, a dedicated department of indigenisation was set up in November 2015 along with a road map for indigenisation till 2030. The MDL has successfully indigenised certain equipment such as sonar dome, ship installed chemical agent detection system, bridge window glass, main batteries for Scorpene submarines, multiple cable transit glands and remote-controlled valves with various companies on a no cost no commitment basis. </p>
