<p style="text-align:justify">“Migratory birds, mammals and aquatic species are increasingly in danger on their migration routes and countries need to work together to protect them.  For India, caring about these species is part of our ethos to protect all animals and natural life on earth.

<p style="text-align:justify">Stressing the urgency to take collaborative action towards conservation, CMS Executive Secretary Ms Amy Fraenkel said: “COP13 comes at a critical time for wildlife conservation, with continued downward trends of habitat loss and species decline.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Among others Chief Minister Shri Vijay Rupani and Minister of State for Environment and Forests Shri Babul Supriyo were also present at the opening ceremony. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Convention on Migratory Species is the only multilateral treaty dedicated to addressing the needs of migratory species and their habitats on a global scale. The conference will set in motion actions needed to better protect migratory species that rely on multilateral cooperation for their survival.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Migratory species of wild animals move from one habitat to another during different times of the year, due to various factors such as food, sunlight, temperature, climate, etc. The movement between habitats, can sometimes exceed thousands of kilometers/miles for some migratory birds and mammals. A migratory route will typically have nesting sites, breeding sites, availability of preferred food and requires the availability of suitable habitat before and after each migration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India is home to several migratory species of wildlife including snow leopard, Amur falcons, bar headed Geese, black necked cranes, marine turtles, dugongs, humpbacked whales, etc.</p>
