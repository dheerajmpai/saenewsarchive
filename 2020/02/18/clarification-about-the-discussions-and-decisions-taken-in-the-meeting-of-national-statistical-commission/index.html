Such coverage by the media is inappropriate, to stay the least, and the Commission unequivocally condemns it.  The Commission is conscious about the initiatives being taken for improving the data quality in the statistical products and processes and works closely with the statistical agencies in the central and state government to ensure its implementation. </p>
