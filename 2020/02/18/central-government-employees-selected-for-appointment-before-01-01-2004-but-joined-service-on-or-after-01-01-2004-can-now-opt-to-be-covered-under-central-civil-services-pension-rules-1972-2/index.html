<p style="text-align:justify">Minister of State (I/C) for the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions Shri Jitendra Singh said that the order effectively gives those employees of the Government of India who were recruited before 2004 the option of either switch over to the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 or continue to be covered under the National Pension System.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Jitendra Singh further added that the landmark decision had been taken by the Department of Pensions and Pensioners’ Welfare to address the longstanding demand of Central Government employees whose recruitment was finalized before 01/01/2004 but who had, for various reasons, joined the services on or after 01/01/2004. However, he noted that the last date to exercise this option would be 31/05/2020, and those who fail to exercise the option by this stipulated date would continue to be covered by the National Pension System.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Central Government by this order has rectified a long standing grievance of a huge number of employees whose recruitment (including written examination, interview and declaration of result) had been finalized on or before 01.01.2004 (which was the cut-off date for employees to be covered under the old Pension scheme) but whose joining was delayed on account of administrative reasons and such delay was beyond the control of such Government servants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This order of the Government of India is expected to give relief to several Central Government employees, some of whom were knocking the doors of the Courts in order to get covered under the CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972 and will also substantially bring down the litigation on this subject matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">A few illustrations where the selection was finalized before 01.01.2004 but actual joining took place on or after 01.01.2004 are as under:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In all the above illustrative cases, since the result for recruitment was declared before 01.01.2004, denial of the benefit of pension under CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972 to the affected Government servants is not considered justified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The matter has been examined in consultation with the Department of Personnel &#038; Training, Department of Expenditure and Department of Legal Affairs in the light of the various representations/references and decisions of the Courts in this regard. It has been decided that in all cases where the results for recruitment were declared before 01.01.2004 against vacancies occurring on or before 31.12.2003, the candidates declared successful for recruitment shall be eligible for coverage under the CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Accordingly, such Government servants who were declared successful for recruitment in the results declared on or before 31.12.2003 against vacancies occurring before 01.01.2004 and are covered under the National Pension System on joining service on or after 01.01.2004, may be given a one-time option to be covered under the CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972. This option may be exercised by the concerned Government servants latest by 31.05.2020.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Those Government servants who are eligible to exercise option in accordance with para-4 above, but who do not exercise this option by the stipulated date, shall continue to be covered by the National Pension System and the option once exercised shall be final.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The matter regarding coverage under the CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972 based on the option exercised by the Government servant shall be placed before the appointing authority for consideration in accordance with these instructions. In case the Government servant fulfils the conditions for coverage under the CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972, in accordance with these instructions, necessary order in this regard shall be issued latest by 30th September, 2020. The NPS account of such Government servants shall, consequently, be closed w.e.f. 01st November, 2020.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Government servants who exercise option to switch over to the pension scheme under CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972, shall be required to subscribe to the General Provident Fund (GPF).</p>
