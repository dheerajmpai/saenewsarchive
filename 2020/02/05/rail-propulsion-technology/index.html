Similarly, safety aspects concern for passengers shall be an integral part of the technical specifications of the hydrogen powered trains. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Solar panels have been fitted on roof top of Diesel Electric Multiple Unit (DEMU) trains of capacity 4.5 KWp for catering to hotel load. Blending of high speed diesel with Bio-diesel by 5% has also been started for railway locomotives. Running of DEMU trains with Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) has also been introduced as pilot project over 18 trains. </p>
