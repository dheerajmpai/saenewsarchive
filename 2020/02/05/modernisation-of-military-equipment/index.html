Modernisation of the Armed Forces is a continuous process undertaken to keep the Forces in a state of readiness to meet operational and security challenges. The modernisation projects are progressed as per approval of Services Capital Acquisition Plans and Annual Acquisition Plans in terms of extant Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP). Based on the allocation of funds under Budget Estimates/Supplementary/Revised Estimates, sufficient funds are made available to meet the critical requirements of Services including Army. The allocated funds are optimally and fully utilised towards operational activities.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">DPP-2016 focuses on streamlining and simplifying defence procurement procedure to give boost to ‘Make in India’ initiative of the Government, by promoting indigenous design, development and manufacturing of defence equipment, platforms, systems and sub-systems. A new Make-II procedure has been introduced in the Defence Procurement Procedure which allows Indian industry to conduct R&#038;D, innovate and submit suo moto proposals for supply of defence equipment.  This provides a new avenue for participation of Indian industry including MSMEs and Startups.  In addition, the Government has also promulgated a policy on Strategic Partnership in the Defence Sector to encourage participation of the private sector in manufacture of major defence platforms and equipment.</p>
