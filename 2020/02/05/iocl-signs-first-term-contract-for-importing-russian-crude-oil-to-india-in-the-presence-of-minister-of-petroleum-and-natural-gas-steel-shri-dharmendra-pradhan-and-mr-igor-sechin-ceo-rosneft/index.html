Both leaders also witnessed the signing of the first-ever Term Contract between IOCL and Rosneft for importing 2 Million Metric Tonnes of Urals grade crude oil during the year 2020 to India. Sourcing of Russian crude oil through long term contracts is a part of India’s strategy for diversifying the country’s crude oil supplies from non-OPEC countries, and a part of the five-year roadmap for bilateral cooperation in the hydrocarbons sector that was signed during Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s visit to Vladivostok last September.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The addition of Russia as a new source for crude oil imports by India’s largest refiner will go a long way in mitigating the risks arising out of geo-political disruptions. The new arrangement would also usher in price stability and energy security for India, which is witnessing robust growth in demand for petroleum products. It will also open up the avenues for other PSU oil refiners to enter into similar term contracts for import of Russian crude oil.</p>

It was noted that the four Indian oil and gas Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) have already submitted the Expression of Interest to Rosneft to participate in the project.
