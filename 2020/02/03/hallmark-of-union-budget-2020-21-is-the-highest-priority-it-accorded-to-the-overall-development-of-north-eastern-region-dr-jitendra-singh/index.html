<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Department of Telecommunications, Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Panchayati Raj and Department of Posts have seen significant increase in their NER Budget. The expenditure of Ministry of Railways and several other Ministries are not included in the above figures.  Railways itself has spent Rs.31,849 Cr in NER from 2014-15 to 2019-20.  Similarly, Airport Authority of India spends a substantial portion of its budget for upgradation of airports in the North East. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dr Singh said that the archaeological site at Shivsagar (Assam) to be developed as an iconic heritage site with on-site Museums in addition to four other sites in the country. Inland Waterways received a boost in the last five years. The 890 Km NW-2 on Brahmaputra between Dhubri-Sadiya would be completed in all respects by 2022. Air traffic has been growing rapidly in the country as compared to global average.  One hundred more airports would be developed by 2024 to support Udaan scheme. In NER, one new and 10 non-operational airports are likely to be operationalized in this period. Krishi Udaan will be launched by the Ministry of Civil Aviation on international and national routes. This will immensely help improve value realisation especially in North-East and tribal districts. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Minister said that to build a seamless national cold supply chain for perishables, inclusive of milk, meat and fish, the Indian Railways will set up a “Kisan Rail” – through PPP arrangements.  There shall be refrigerated coaches in Express and Freight trains as well.  This would enable perishable agri-horticultural produce of the North East to be transported to the rest of the country, thus contributing to the Government’s target for increase in farmer income.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dr Jitendra Singh also informed that the Budget for North East Council just doubled from Rs 700 crore to Rs 1474 crore in the last five years. He said, Union Cabinet on 28th January, 2020 accorded its approval for allocating 30% of NEC’s allocation for new projects under the existing “Schemes of North Eastern Council” for focused development of deprived areas; deprived/neglected sections of society and emerging priority sectors in the North Eastern States. The balance allocation shall be bifurcated in the existing two components (State component-60% and Central component-40%). He said this would not only lead to balanced socio-economic development of North East and reduce inter region and inter-tribes/community disparities, but would also lead to preservation of cultural diversity of North East and save the scripts/languages which are gradually becoming extinct.  The development of sustainable agriculture practices like organic farming in place of Jhum Cultivation would lead to Green North East.</p>
