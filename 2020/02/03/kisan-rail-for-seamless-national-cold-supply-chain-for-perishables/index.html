Prosperity to farmers can be ensured by making farming competitive. For this, purchase of farm produce, logistics and agri‐services need copious  investments. Farmers desire integrated solutions covering storage, financing, processing and         marketing. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The budget proposes that “To build a  seamless  national  cold  supply  chain  for  perishables, inclusive of milk, meat and fish, the Indian Railways will set up a “Kisan Rail”- through PPP  arrangements. There shall be refrigerated coaches in Express and Freight trains as well.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Towards fulfillment of the budget proposals, following are the major initiatives which have already been taken by Indian Railways regarding Development of Cold Chain for Transportation of Perishable Traffic</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Refrigerated Parcel Vans:    New design of Refrigerated Parcel Vans (VPR, carrying capacity of 17 tonnes) for transportation of highly perishable parcel traffic was developed, and procured through Rail Coach Factory Kapurthala. At present, Indian Railway has a fleet of nine (09) Refrigerated    Parcel Vans available.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">These Refrigerated Parcel Vans are booked on round-trip basis, and are charged at 1.5 times the freight of normal VP as per category of train.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Reefer (Ventilated Insulated) Rail Containers:      98 Ventilated Insulated Containers (Carrying capacity 12 Tonnes per container, rake composition 80 containers)  have been procured, through CONCOR, for movement of fruits and vegetables to different parts of the country.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Cold Storage Facilities for Perishables:      ‘Temperature controlled perishable cargo centres’ have been commissioned at Ghazipur Ghat (U.P), New Azadpur (Adarsh Nagar, Delhi) and Raja ka Talab (U.P) as a pilot project under Kisan Vision Project by CONCOR under CSR initiative. Another    project is under construction at Lasalgaon, Nasik (Maharashtra).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Approval has been granted to Central Railside Warehousing Corporation (CRWC) to develop temperature controlled storages at Fatuha and Mancheswar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Cold storage facility has also been developed at Dadri. Fresh &#038; Healthy Enterprise Ltd. (FHEL) has been redeveloped as Agriculture Logistic Center at Rai, Sonepat. This facility is CONCOR’s 100% own subsidiary developed in an area of 16.40 acres of land.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In  his  Independence  Day  speech  2019,  Hon’ble Prime Minister  had  highlighted  that   Rs. 100  lakh  crore would  be  invested  on  infrastructure over the next 5 years. As a follow up measure, the National Infrastructure Pipeline was launched on 31st December 2019.  It  consists  of  more  than  6500  projects  across  sectors  and  are  classified as per their size and stage of development. These new projects will also include  modern  railway  stations,  metro  and  railway  transportation,  logistics  and  warehousing etc. </p>
