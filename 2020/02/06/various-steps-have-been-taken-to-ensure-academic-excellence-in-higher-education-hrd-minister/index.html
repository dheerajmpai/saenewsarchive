Issues relating to improvement of quality of education, promoting research and innovation, faculty development, collaboration with the industry and research laboratories, effective use of technology in teaching-learning process, mandatory accreditation, etc. are periodically reviewed with Vice Chancellors of Central Universities by University Grants Commission (UGC) and Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Central Universities are statutory autonomous organizations and they are free to explore different avenues towards academic excellence. Besides, all Central Universities are required to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Administrative Ministry or Department, spelling out clearly performance parameters, output targets in terms of details of programme of work and qualitative improvement in output, along with commensurate input requirements. </p>
