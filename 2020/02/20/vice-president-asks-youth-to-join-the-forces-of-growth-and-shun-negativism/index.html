He asked the youth to take the lead in fighting corruption, terrorism, extremism, religious fundamentalism, casteism, and gender discrimination.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Addressing the 10th edition of Chhatra Sansad in New Delhi, Shri Naidu said that corruption was eating into the vitals of our democracy and called upon youth to be at the forefront in eliminating the scourge of corruption and other ills plaguing society.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Naidu also wanted the youth to take an active interest in politics and the affairs of the country and participate in nation-building activities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Observing that India was the largest democracy, Shri Naidu said that politics was a vehicle for serving the people, bringing about the desired social-economic change, taking the country to new levels of development and strengthening the foundations of democracy. “This is where young students &#8212; educated and informed citizens &#8212; should engage more to have meaningful political participation,” he added.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Urging Parliamentarians and others in public life to raise the standards of debate in different forums, Shri Naidu said that Rajya Sabha, Lok Sabha and state legislatures in the country should be shining examples in setting standards for people. “Mantra for a healthy democracy is &#8212; discuss, debate and decide and not disrupt. Agree to disagree and be tolerant of the mandate of the people,” he added.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Naidu advised the youth to understand more about India’s history, heritage, culture and sacrifices made by freedom fights and national leaders, apart from the radical changes brought out by social reformers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He asked the youth to enrich their knowledge by studying the debates that took place in the Constituent Assembly as also the speeches delivered by eminent MPs in Parliament from time-to- time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Touching upon the importance of the Constitution, the Vice President said that everyone should follow constitutional methods to achieve his or her goals and pointed out that the fundamental rights and duties go hand-in-hand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Describing terrorism as the biggest threat to world peace and humanity, the Vice President said that India always believed in peaceful co-existence with all nations and lamented that one of the neighbours was aiding, abetting and funding terror. He asserted that India would not tolerate any outside interference in its internal affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Expressing concern over the rise in non-communicable diseases due to unhealthy dietary habits and changing lifestyles, the Vice President asked the youth shun sedentary lifestyle and adopt healthy food habits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He wanted youth to take lead in transforming programs such as the Beti Bachao scheme, other initiatives like Swachh Bharat, Yoga, Fitness India, water conservation and Per Drop More Crop into national movements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri P. Sreeramakrishnan, Hon’ble Speaker, Kerala Legislative Assembly, Shri Shivraj Patil, Former Speaker, Lok Sabha, Former Governor of Punjab &#038; U.T. of Chandigarh, Dr Vijay P. Bhatkar, Former Chairman, Board of Governors, IIT Delhi &#038; Chancellor, Nalanda University, Prof. Dr Vishwanath D. Karad, Founder President, MIT World Peace University, Pune and Dr Raghunath A.

<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Following is the full text of the speech – </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“I am delighted to address the 10th edition of Bharatiya Chhatra Sansad and share my thoughts with all of you here today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It is heartening that thousands of youngsters are taking active interest in politics and various issues concerning the nation. We must treat every walk of life, including politics, as a mission.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Politics is a vehicle for serving the people, bringing about the desired socio-economic change, taking the country to new levels of development and strengthening the foundations of democracy. This is where young students &#8212; educated and informed citizens &#8212; should engage more to have a meaningful political participation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Please note that India is the largest Parliamentary democracy in the world. As a matter-of-fact, Parliamentary democracy is the best form of governance and I would like our parliamentarians and all other public representatives to raise the standards of debate in every forum. The mantra for a healthy democracy is&#8211; discuss, debate and decide and not disrupt. Agree to disagree and be tolerant towards the mandate of the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It is quite depressing to see that some people have developed a culture of not understanding or appreciating others’ viewpoint and never seriously listen to those who do not think alike. The irony is the same people accuse others of intolerance while not being tolerant to the views of others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Over the millennia, India is known for its tolerance and pluralistic ethos. This was best summed by Swami Vivekananda during his famous address to the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago when he had said: “ I am proud to belong to a religion which has taught the world both tolerance and universal acceptance. We believe not only in universal toleration but we accept all religions as true…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I would like the youth of the country to take an active interest in public life. All of you must read history and know about the sacrifices made by our national leaders and freedom fighters, apart from the radical changes brought in the society by great social reformers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dear youngsters,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">All of you must also read the debates that took place in the Constituent Assembly as also the speeches that were given by eminent MPs in the Parliament from time to time to enrich your knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I am also happy that in recent times people are talking about the importance of the Constitution. It indeed is a positive sign and every citizen must follow the Constitution in letter and spirit. Also, everyone should follow constitutional methods to achieve his/ her goals. We should not only be concerned about fundamental rights but also about duties. Rights and responsibilities must go together.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The need of the hour is to channelize the energies of the youth in constructive, nation-building activities. My advice to youth is to shun negativism and not to encourage violence. There is no place for violence in a democracy. Be constructive and not obstructive or disruptive. Develop a positive outlook. Join the forces of growth as India is passing through a critical phase.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This is the time for all sections, particularly the youth to be at the forefront of making India stronger on all fronts. Please remember that discipline, honesty and total commitment to hard work are essential prerequisites for success in any field, including public life.  Always select and elect leaders on the basis of 4 Cs—Good Conduct, Character, Capacity and Caliber and not on the basis of other 4Cs&#8211;Caste, Community, Cash and Criminality.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Perhaps, it will be apt to recall the words of Swami Vivekananda, who had said: “My hope of the future lies in the youths of character, intelligent, renouncing all for the services of others, and obedient – good to themselves and the country at large”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It is pertinent to recall that the youth were at the forefront during the freedom movement and also during India’s fight against the imposition of Emergency.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dear sisters and brothers,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Prime Minister, Shri Narendrabhai Modi had given a three-word mantra—Reform, Perform and Transform. The transformation of the nation in all spheres is needed to accelerate the progress of the country and improve the living standards of the people, particularly of the downtrodden and marginalized sections.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Even 72 years after attaining Independence, India is facing many daunting challenges like poverty, illiteracy, casteism, social and gender discrimination in certain areas. Also, certain vested interests are trying to create fissiparous tendencies among the people, mislead and misguide youth on important national issues. I urge the youth to be on guard and see through the designs of such forces and not fall prey to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India’s worldview has always been guided by the philosophy of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam—The World Is One Family”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dear sisters and brothers,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Please remember that India was once known as Vishwaguru and   economically superior to many other regions and used to contribute more than 20 percent of the world GDP. Yet, despite its pre-eminent position, India never attacked any country but only became a victim of foreign invasions and colonial conquests.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dear youngsters,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> The time has come for India to regain its pre-eminent position in the comity of nations. India is today blessed with a huge demographic advantage as 65 percent of the population is below the age of 35 years and more than 50 percent around 25 years. Thus, youth will be playing a leading role in making India achieve greater glory in the years to come.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The need of the hour is to not only educationally empower the youth, but also provide them with the requisite skills to surmount the challenges of the 21st century and stay ahead of the curve. Industry–academia linkages should be part of the educational curriculum. As a matter-of-fact, our universities should be places of intellectual interaction and must welcome every idea with open arms as suggested by an eminent educationist.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In fact, I would like to recall the famous words of the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, who had said: “I do not want my house to be walled in on all sides and my windows to be stuffed. I want the culture of all lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible. But I refuse to be blown off my feet by any”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Our education system has to be completely revamped. Apart from equipping our students with 21st century knowledge and skills, it should infuse spiritual and ethical values and lay strong stress on character building. It is equally important for our textbooks to give a proper account of Indian history and highlight the pivotal role played by freedom fighters from all over the country, including Bhagat Singh, Veer Damodar Savarkar, Veerapandian Kattabomman, Alluri Seetharama Raju, Sarojini Naidu and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">We also need to promote the spirit of entrepreneurship among youth to ensure they not only seek employment but become job creators. Flagship schemes like Start-Up India and Digital India are aimed at tapping the entrepreneurial talent among youth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dear youngsters,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">There is a need for a national movement to eradicate poverty and illiteracy and wipe out various social evils, which are hampering the progress of the nation. As mentioned earlier, the youth of the country should be at the forefront of eliminating the scourge of corruption and other ills plaguing society.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Corruption is eating into the vitals of our democracy and every citizen, particularly the youth, should be at the forefront in the fight against this evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dear youngsters,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">You should always remain rooted to our age-old civilizational values and culture. From time immemorial, India has the tradition of respecting women, teachers and elderly people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">However, the gradual decline in values over the years is also reflective of the manner in which women and girls are being treated. It is unfortunate that we are frequently coming across instances of gender discrimination and atrocities against women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">No civilized society can accept such incidents or any kind of ill-treatment against women. There is a need to change the mindset of boys from a young age and the parents and teachers have a major role in moulding the character and attitude of boys from a young age. I am happy to note that the progressive ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ scheme has made a tremendous impact across the country.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The gross enrollment ratio of girls is higher than that of boys in educational institutions. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Like Beti Bachao scheme, other initiatives like Swachh Bharat, Yoga, Fitness India, water conservation and Per Drop More Crop should also become national movements with active participation of the people, especially the youth. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The outbreak of COVID-19 (Coronavirus) and the alarming manner in which it is spreading across the world underlines the importance of maintaining cleanliness and hygiene.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Similarly, the growing incidence of Non-communicable Diseases (NCDs) in India is a matter of concern. The need of the hour is to arrest this trend and take up massive awareness campaigns among the people, particularly the youngsters to stay fit and healthy. Factors such as a sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy dietary habits have been associated with NCDs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dear youngsters, the Prime Minister, Shri Narendabhai Modi had recently given a call for Fitness India. The youth are the future of the nation and the progress of the society and the nation depends on their wellbeing.   </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I am happy to note that various important topics such as the need to combat terrorism, insurgency &#038; Maoist menace, the bane of casteism, making India a $ 5 trillion economy and reaching the goal of zero poverty &#038; zero hunger are being discussed at this Sansad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> Terrorism is the biggest threat to world peace and humanity. Time and again terrorism has been raising its ugly head in different parts of the globe. India has been a victim of this mindless violence for the past many decades as one of our neighbors has been aiding, abetting, training and funding terror-related activities. The time has come for the United Nations to conclude the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism without any delay as the proposal mooted by India has been pending since 1996.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">India always believed in peaceful co-existence with all its neighbors but will not tolerate any outside interference in its internal affairs. The Reorganization of Jammu and Kashmir into Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh Union Territories was aimed at accelerating development in the three regions and to extend the benefits of all the schemes to the people living there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dear youngsters, today being the International Mother Language Day, I urge all of you to always speak in your mother tongue at home. In fact, I have been appealing to all state governments to make it mandatory the teaching of all subjects in mother tongue up to primary/ high school level. It is our collective responsibility to protect and preserve all our languages.  Please remember that language is the lifeline of culture.  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It should also be noted that climate change has become a reality and the weather patterns are increasingly becoming unpredictable. We are witnessing extreme weather events time and again in different parts of the globe. I have always been advising youngsters to love and live with nature. Preserve culture and protect nature for a better future. We all must strive collectively to protect nature. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Finally, before concluding, I would once again urge the youth to resolve: to shun violence; to join the forces of growth; to fight against corruption; to fight against terror, extremism, religious fundamentalism, casteism and gender discrimination; to develop leadership qualities through 4 Cs&#8211;good Conduct, Character, Capacity and Calibre and to always maintain discipline.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I am sure these sessions will be a good learning experience for all of you.  My best wishes for all your future endeavours.”</p>
