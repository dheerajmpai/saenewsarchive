<p style="text-align:justify">Undertaken by the Union Ministry of Rural Development, the SPMRM focuses on cluster-based integrated development through Spatial Planning. Rurban clusters are identified across the country’s rural areas showing increasing signs of urbanization &#8211; i.e. increase in population density, high levels of non-farm employment, presence of growing economic activities and other socioeconomic parameters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Mission aims to transform these Rurban clusters by stimulating local economic development, enhancing basic services, and creating well planned Rurban clusters. This would lead to holistic development of the region and encourage integrated and inclusive rural development. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Under the mission 300 Rurban clusters are envisaged to be developed in a timebound manner. Of these 296 clusters have been selected and number of Integrated Cluster Action Plans (ICAPs) approved are 288 and Detailed Project Reports of 240 have been approved.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">SPMRM is a Core Centrally Sponsored Scheme, The Mission has two fund streams: (1) Convergence through various Central sector schemes, centrally sponsored schemes, State sector/ sponsored schemes/ programmes, CSR funds, and (2) Critical Gap Funds (CGF). It provides for CGF upto Rs. 30 crore per cluster for Non-tribal clusters, and upto Rs. 15 crore per cluster for Tribal and Hilly State clusters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Currently, total Central Share funds released till date is Rs. 1,842.97 cr. Total  investment approved in 288 ICAPs is Rs.28,075 cr with convergence being Rs.21,194 cr and Rs. 6,882cr. Of this, total expenditure, as on 30th November 2019, was Rs.6,689 cr of which Rs. 5,619 cr formed convergence and Rs. 1,071 cr under CGF. The CGF Funds release is expected to cross target of Rs. 1,200 crore by 31st March, 2020.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Infrastructure planned in these clusters includes provision of 24/7 water supply to all households, Solid and Liquid Waste Management facilities at the household and cluster level, provision of Inter and Intra village roads within the cluster, adequate street lights and public transport facilities using green technologies. Economic amenities in a cluster comprise various thematic areas in the sectors of Agri Services and Processing, Tourism, and Skill Development to promote Small and Medium Scale Enterprises.</p>
