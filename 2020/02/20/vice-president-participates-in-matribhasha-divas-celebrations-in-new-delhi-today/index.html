<p style="text-align:justify">Speaking on the occasion Union HRD Minister Shri Nishank said that the Mother tongue refers to the language that a person learns without any effort and to which the person has a deep emotional attachment. Shri Pokhriyal said that the language is not only a medium of communication;it has a strong social, cultural, geographical and economic connect with the speakers of that society as well. He further said that our country believes in the concept of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam. So, we not just only respect each other&#8217;s language and culture, but also assimilate it and live it. In a country like India, where about thousands of languages ​​and dialects are spoken, each language has its own significance and identity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Shri Pokhriyal highlighted that while we take pride in that India has such a large number of mother tongues, on the other hand, 196 languages ​​of India have been included in the list of endangered languages ​​released by UNESCO, which is a matter of concern. Not only are some languages and dialects fading away or are on the verge of getting extinct, sadly the condition of many major languages ​​is also of grave concern. He further added that the main reason is that sometimes people suffer from inferiority complex in relation to their mother tongue, but one should understand that no language is major or minor, rich or poor and strong or weak. Now the time has come for us to document and preserve our languages, as well as to encourage them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Minister informed that the Matribhasha Diwas is celebrated to promote linguistic and cultural diversity and multilingualism in the world, as well as to spread awareness about languages. He said that every year UNESCO celebrates International Mother Language Day with a new theme. The theme of this year (2020) is &#8220;Languages ​​without Borders&#8221; which means languages ​​across/devoid of geographical boundaries.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">While addressing the gathering, Shri Prahlad Singh Patel said that we are proud of all the languages butundoubtedly the mother tongue plays an important role in the development of one’s personality. Although one learns many languages as per the needs, the emotional connection remains with one’s own mother tongue. He added that every language in India has vast history and linguistic society and a cultural perspective. He stressed upon promoting vernacular languages across the world, to remain connected beyond the boundaries.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Speaking at the event, Minister of State for HRD Shri Sanjay Dhotre said that mother tongue is the first language that anyone acquires from one&#8217;s parents and the surrounding. And one is most comfortable in articulating oneself in their respective mother tongues only. Hence mother tongue should be preferred as the medium of instruction in the classroomespeciallyin primary classes. Shri Dhotre also added that in India most of the people are either bilingual or multilingual. This phenomenon and the larger linguistic diversity of our country are an asset to cherish.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">MHRD along with educational institutions and language institutions is celebrating the Matribhasha Diwas.
