<p style="text-align:justify">Stressing the need for value-based education, Shri Naidu said that education should focus on overall development of the students by imparting morals, ethics and age old civilizational values of the country. A teacher has prominent role after parents in shaping the life of a student, he said.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Describing ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ as the essence of Indian culture, Shri Naidu said that secularism is in the blood and veins of every Indian and minorities are more secure in India than any other country of the world.

<p style="text-align:justify">Stressing that peace was a prerequisite for development, the Vice President said that in a democracy, everyone has a right to dissent and protest but it should be done in a peaceful manner.
