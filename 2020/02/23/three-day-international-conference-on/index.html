In an EPS, a number of similar models, called the ensemble members, are run from slightly different initial conditions.  It requires high computational resources and in turn provides the flow dependent forecast uncertainty in terms of probability. The probabilistic forecasts help the end users in making decisions and plan their actions suitably.  The forecasts from high resolution global and regional EPS provide more accurate probabilistic forecasts of extreme weather events and help the planners and administrators in taking timely actions.  India has recently operationally implemented two global EPS which have highest resolution in the world and also a regional EPS of horizontal resolution 4km which covers the Indian region. A well-coordinated collaborative research and development work between national and international centres are further required for progressively improving the skill of EPS. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In order to provide a platform for discussions and deliberations on the present status, future prospects and optimum use of EPS, a three-day international conference on “Ensemble Methods in Modelling and Data Assimilation (EMMDA)” is being organised by NCMRWF,MoES from February 24, 2020 at NCMRWF, Noida, India. The major themes of the conference are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Leading International experts from ECMWF of UK, Met Office of UK, NOAA of USA, KMA of South Korea, BoM of Australia, NCAR of USA, University of Maryland of USA, Reading University of UK, NIWA of New Zealand, KAUST of Saudi Arabia, TMD of Thailand will present papers along with distinguished Indian scientists from different lead organizations on latest developments in the field of ensemble data assimilation and modelling. About twenty young scientists and researchers will present their research outcomes. Besides them about 100 participants which include forecasters, stake holder from various sectors and young research scholars will attend this conference.   </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The latest techniques used in Data Assimilation, Ensemble Methods, and use of Probabilistic Forecasts for developing new applications from Ensemble Products will be discussed. The discussions will lead to development of newer algorithms and will be useful for societal applications related to weather/climate.   </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This international conference on EMDDA will be inaugurated by Dr.Harsh Vardhan, Union</p>
