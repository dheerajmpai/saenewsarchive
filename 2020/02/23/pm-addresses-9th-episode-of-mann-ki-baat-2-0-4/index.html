Lauding the enthusiasm of the youngsters, he said, “When I was in Bengaluru during Chandrayaan-2, I witnessed immense enthusiasm &#038; fervor on the part of the children present there. There was no sign of drowsiness from any angle. In a way, they kept awake throughout the night. One can never forget their inquisitiveness when it came to Science, Technology and Innovation”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Sharing his thoughts in Mann Ki Baat today, the Prime Minister said, to give a fillip to this enthusiasm in children &#038; young people and to encourage scientific temper in them, recently a facility has been made to watch rocket launching at Sriharikota. This facility has been made open for all and can be booked online. He also urged the Principals &#038; Teachers of all schools to avail of this benefit in times to come.  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In this context, he lauded ISRO&#8217;s &#8216;Yuvika&#8217; programme which integrates the youth with science. ‘Yuvika&#8217;  stands for &#8216; Yuva Vigyani Karyakram and was launched for school students in the year 2019. This program is in consonance with our vision, &#8220;Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan, Jai Anusandhaan’, he added. Prime Minister Modi also called for young students to join the programme by visiting “www.yuvika.isro.gov.in”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Prime Minister applauded the efforts of the scientists of CSIR and Indian Institute of Petroleum, Dehradun, who developed the technology to fly an aircraft with bio-fuel. He said that their efforts also empower the ‘Make in India’ mission. He said that history was made when an Indian Air Force AN-32 aircraft took off from Leh&#8217;s Kushok Bakula Rimpochee Airport with a mixture of 10% Indian Bio-jet fuel and this was the first time that this mix was used in both engines. He said the bio-jet fuel was prepared from non-edible tree borne oil which was procured from various tribal areas of India. These efforts will not only reduce carbon emissions but may also reduce India&#8217;s dependence on crude oil imports, he added.</p>
