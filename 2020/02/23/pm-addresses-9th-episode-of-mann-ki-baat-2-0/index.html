He said the region of Purnia in Bihar is an inspiration for people across the country. This area has been grappling with the havoc caused by floods for decades together. In this backdrop, it has been very difficult to do farming and mobilize other sources of income. He said, earlier women of Purnia used to cultivate cocoons from silkworms and received a very nominal price but merchants bought this and made huge profits by spinning into silk yarn. But under these very circumstances, some women of Purnia chose a different path. Now women in Purnia formed a production cooperative with the assistance from the Government, producing the silk yarns and selling the saris made out of it and earning a huge sum, he added.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He also shared the inspiring story of the achievement of Kamya Karthikeyan, who conquered Mount Aconcagua at the age of twelve. This is the highest peak of the Andes Mountains in South America, which is about 7000 meters high, he added. “She is now on a new mission, called &#8216;Mission Saahas&#8217;, under which she is trying to conquer the highest peaks of all the continents,” he said. He applauded her efforts for bringing positive results in motivating everyone to stay fit and conveyed his best wishes for ‘Mission Saahas’. Mentioning how the geography of India provides many opportunities for adventure sports in our country, the Prime Minister appealed to the people to visit the place of their choice and activity of their interest and integrate their life with adventure. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Furthermore, he narrated the success story of 105-year-old Bhagirathi Amma who lives in Kollam in Kerala and lost her mother and husband at a very young age. She restarted her school education at the age of 105! She started studying again! In spite of her advanced age, Bhagirathi Amma wrote her level 4 exam and then eagerly awaited her results. She scored 75 percent in her exams and wants to continue her education. He said that people like Bhagirathi Amma are the strength of this country; a great source of inspiration for all of us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He cited the example of Salman who lives in Hamirpur village of Moradabad, and is divyang by birth. He said that despite this hardship, he hasn’t lost hope, and decided to start his own business. On top of that, he resolved to help other divyang people too. And soon enough, Salman started manufacturing slippers and detergent in his village itself. And in no time, 30 divyang people joined him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">He also narrated the story of  similar determination that has been manifested by residents of Ajrak village in Kutch area of Gujarat. In 2001, after the devastating earthquake, most villagers were migrating from the village. However, one person by the name of Ismail Khatri, decided to stay back and nurture his traditional art form of ‘Ajrak print’. And in no time at all, everyone was enchanted by the natural colours used in the Ajrak art. And the entire village joined in on their traditional handicraft category.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Prime Minister conveyed his best wishes to the nation for the recently celebrated Mahashivratri. he said, “On the occasion of Mahashivaratri, may you continue to be blessed by Bhole baba…may Lord Shiva fulfill all your wishes…may you be energetic, healthy…and continue to do your duties unto the country.” </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Prime Minister added, “In the coming days, we will celebrate Holi and soon after that, Gudi Padva will be celebrated. The festival of Navaraatri is also associated with spring. Ram Navami will also be celebrated. Festivals and celebrations are an inseparable part of the social fabric of our country. Every festival has a hidden social message which binds not just the society, but the entire country into a spirit of unity.”</p>
