<p style="text-align:justify">The FPI Minister held one on one meetings with the companies involved in Food business in the UAE. Based on the discussions it was proposed to explore the possibility of setting up a fund for providing marketing support to launch Indian products in the UAE super markets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">During discussions with the India UAE Food security corridor project representative, the Minister proposed that existing MOFPI supported  infra may be utilised to give a head start to the project. Smt. Harsimrat Kaur Badal emphasized on fast tracking the project and mentioned that all necessary support for grounding the project will be provided by the Ministry through Invest India.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Smt. Badal said that India and UAE have been amongst each other’s largest trading partners for the last several years. Currently UAE is the third largest trading partner with bilateral trade reaching US$ 59.909 in 2018-19.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Minister informed that the Food Processing Sector in India being a sunrise sector is poised for exponential growth and has emerged as a high growth sector due to its immense potential for value addition, ability to control inflation and ensure remunerative prices to farmers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Smt. Harsimrat Kaur Badal informed the delegates that India is a huge and promising market with 1.3 billion population, increasing purchasing power, adequate availability of raw materials, availability of young and skilled manpower and a number of fiscal incentives that are being offered by the Indian Government for encouraging investments in this sector. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">A number of steps have been taken to improve the environment of ease of doing business under the “Make in India” initiative of Hon’ble Prime Minister which focuses on making India a Global Manufacturing Hub. The regulatory mechanism for Food related industries in India has been aligned with the international standards making the Indian exports more acceptable to the global markets.  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">FPI Minister added that food items are one of the major Indian exports to UAE. While India is rich in production of food grains, fruits, vegetables &#038; milk but lacks in processing infrastructure, UAE has surplus funds and technology available to create such facilities but lacks in availability of raw material. Thus a partnership between India and UAE can ensure Food Security for the Gulf nation in the times to come.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Union Minister interacted with several other companies and motivated them to increasingly focus on Make in India and providing organic solutions to further increase country’s exports.

APEDA is participating with more than 100 exporters in the Gulf Food.</p>
