Taking inspiration from this idea PM said that 21st century India is working for Antyodaya. He added that on this holy occasion, about Rs.1250 crore worth of projects which have been launched, will benefit the entire Purvanchal, including Varanasi. “All these projects are part of the resolution of rejuvenation going on in the entire Purvanchal including Kashi for the last 5 years.

In line with the Deen Dayal Ji’s thoughts that self-reliance and self-help should be at the center of all schemes, the Prime Minister said that efforts are constantly being made to bring these ideas into the government&#8217;s plans and the government&#8217;s culture.</p>
