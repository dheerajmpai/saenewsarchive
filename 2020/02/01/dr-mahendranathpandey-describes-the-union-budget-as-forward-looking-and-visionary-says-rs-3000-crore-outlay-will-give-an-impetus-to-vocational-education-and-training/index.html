In a statement, he said that Rs. 3000 crore outlay will give an impetus to vocational education and training, andgive wings to the Skill India Mission and the overall skilling ecosystem of the country. Following is the statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">“I welcome Budget 2020 for its forward-looking and visionary approach towards nation-building and for creating pathways for the youth to fulfill their aspirations. By tying skill development with education, Hon’ble Finance Minister Smt. NirmalaSitharaman has given wings to the Skill India Mission and the overall skilling ecosystem of the country. India is a treasure trove of gifted individuals who must be skilled in order for them to realize their dreams. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Rs. 3000 crore outlay will give an impetus to vocational education and training. Under the current plans, we are already proving skill training across 8000 schools and institutes, with 400 hours in classes 9-10 and 500 hours in classes 11-12 for one trade. The Budget 2020 makes a provision for expanding the net to other schools as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Making apprenticeships mainstream by introducing it in degree and diploma courses in 150 institutes of higher learning will boost the Government’s efforts to make learning-on-the-job a major step towards creating a ready workforce. It is a recognition of the success of the Shreyas pilot launched in 2019 in select colleges for BA, BCom and BSc undergraduates, with apprenticeship embedded in courses in retail, tourism and logistics sectors. Much will depend on our ability to create a young brigade of trained and motivated professionals who are exposed to real-life situations. Giving internship opportunities to engineering students at the local level will not only prepare the youth in actual environments but will also bring disruptive benefits to the state by optimizing new talent and fresh ideas. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The thrust on creating healthcare providers who are in high demand is an inspirational move. The Ministries of Health and Skill Development will work in tandem to build special bridge courses to meet the demand for teachers, nurses, paramedical staff and caregivers, both in India and abroad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The budget also focuses on heavy investment in infrastructure which will again increase the scope for skilled workforce in the country. Skill Development will also continue to serve as a backbone for all the other initiatives like PM Kusum, KrishiUdan, JalJeevanMission, Warehouse development etc., creating opportunities of employment and enhancing overall productivity and outcome. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">By announcing the Government’s intent to focus on the entrepreneurship spirit of Indians, the Hon’ble Finance Minister has paved the way for the future of the country and for making India the Skill Capital of the World.”</p>
