Similar trends in gross enrolment ratio were also observed at secondary and higher secondary levels, she added.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Emphasising on nutrition as a critical component on health, Nirmala Sitharaman proposed to provide Rs 35,600 crore for nutrition-related programmes for the year 2020-21. She drew attention to the Poshan Abhiyan which was launched in 2017-18 to improve the nutritional status of children (0-6 years), adolescent girls, pregnant women and lactating mothers. The Union Minister further said that more than six lakh anganwadi workers have been equipped with smart phones to upload the nutritional status of more than 10 crore households, which is an unprecedented development.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In her Budget speech, the Finance Minister also announced that a task force will be appointed to recommend regarding lowering MMR and improving nutrition levels. She noted that with India’s progress, opportunities were opening up for women to pursue higher education and careers, and the entire issue about age of a girl entering motherhood, therefore, needed to be seen in a new light. She proposed to appoint a task force for this purpose which would present its recommendations in six months’ time.</p>
