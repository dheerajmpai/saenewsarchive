While presenting the Union Budget 2020-21 in Parliament today, the Union Minister for Finance &#038; Corporate Affairs, Smt Nirmala Sitharaman said, “The dividend shall be taxed only in the hands of the recipients at their applicable rates.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Further, in order to remove the cascading effect, the Finance Minister has proposed to allow deduction for the dividend received by holding company from its subsidiary. The removal of DDT will lead to estimated annual revenue forgone of Rs. 25,000 crore.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Currently, companies are required to pay DDT on the dividend paid to its shareholders at the rate of 15% plus applicable surcharge and cess in addition to the tax payable by the company on its profits, the Minister said. It has been argued, she added, that the system of levying DDT results in increase in tax burden for investors and specially those who are liable to pay tax less than the rate of DDT, if the dividend income is included in their income. Further, non-availability of credit of DDT to most of the foreign investors in their home country results in reduction of rate of return on equity capital for them. </p>
