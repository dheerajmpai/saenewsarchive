So far, nearly 88% FPSs in the country have been automated by installing ePoS devices at FPSs. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As regard financial assistance to States/UTs, ‘The Food Security (Assistance to State Governments) Rules 2015’ under NFSA provides for reimbursement of an additional dealer margin to States/UTs at the rate of Rs.17 per quintal of foodgrains distributed through the ePoS devices, to meet up the expenditure incurred towards the purchasing cost, operational/ running/ maintenance expenses of ePoS devices and incentives for their use. Such expenditure would be shared between Centre and State/UT Governments on 75:25 basis for 23 Special Category States/UTs and on 50:50 basis for 13 General Category States/UTs. So far, this Department has released a total of about Rs. 100 Crore to concerned States under NFSA during the current financial year.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">To sustain the reforms brought in by the scheme on ‘End-to-End Computerization of TPDS Operations’ and to introduce new reforms, the Department in association with States/UTs is implementing another scheme namely “Integrated Management of Public Distribution System (IM-PDS)” w.e.f. April 2018 with a total outlay of Rs. 127 Crore. The main objective of the scheme is to introduce nation-wide portability of ration card holders under National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA), through &#8216;One Nation One Ration Card&#8217; system. This system enables the migratory ration card holders/beneficiaries to lift their entitled foodgrains from any Fair Price Shop (FPS) of their choice in the country by using their existing/same ration card issued in their home State/UT after biometric/Aadhaar authentication on electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) devices installed at the FPSs. So far this facility is available in 12 States.</p>
