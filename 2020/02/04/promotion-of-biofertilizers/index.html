Based on the recommendations, steps for technical trainings to the staff on testing protocols and quality parameters; streamlining of testing protocols;  revamping the quality testing labs;   ensuring supply of quality biofertiliser  mother strains from ICAR institutions for   production of biofertilisers etc.  have been initiated. States were also asked to ensure quality of biofertilisers promoted under organic farming schemes.  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Regular trainings, front line demonstrations are conducted by National Centre for Organic Farming (NCOF) and Indian Council of Agriculture Research    (ICAR)   to educate farmers on biofertilizers.           Government has been providing financial assistance of   Rs. 31,000/ha/3 years and Rs 7500/ha/3 years      for organic conversion, organic inputs, including biofertilisers under  Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana and Mission Organic Value Chain development  North East Region(MOVCDNER) respectively.  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) under “Network project on Soil Biodiversity- Biofertilizers   project” has developed improved and efficient strains of biofertilizers specific to different crops and soil types. Biofertilizers can improve yields by 10-25% in most of the cases when used along with chemical fertilizers. Liquid biofertilizers technology with higher shelf-life has also been developed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Government under Capital Investment Subsidy Scheme (CISS) of Soil Health Management Scheme (SHM) of National Mission of Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) is providing assistance for   Setting up of State of art liquid/ carrier based Bio-fertilizer/ Bio-pesticide units of 200 Ton Per Annum (TPA) capacity. 100% assistance is provided to State Govt. / Govt. Agencies upto a maximum limit of Rs.160.00 lakh/ unit. Similarly, for individuals/ private agencies assistance upto 25% of cost limited to Rs.40 lakh/unit   as capital investment is provided through NABARD. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As per data provided by NABARD, 61 Biofertilizer/ Fruit and vegetable compost production units   were established under Capital Investment Subsidy scheme in different states. Similarly funding for 10 biofertiliser production units and 16 organic/biofertiliser testing labs was done through Soil Health Management Scheme since 2015.   </p>
