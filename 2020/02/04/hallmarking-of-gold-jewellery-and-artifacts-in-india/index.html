<p style="text-align:justify">Only three grades namely 14,18 and 22 carats for gold jewellery and artefacts, as prescribed in Indian Standard IS: 1417: 2016 can be hallmarked. As on 25 Dec 2019, 892 Hallmarking and Assaying (A &#038; H) centres throughout India have been recognized by BIS.   The average number of articles hallmarked per day per centre in the year is nearly 225 only. A typical centre can hallmark 500 pieces per shift (or about 1500 pieces per day) with one set of machines. Thus, the average utilization of the capacity of the A&#038;H centres is less than 50 % and therefore, the average utilization of the capacity of the A&#038;H centres is less than 50% and as on date there is no capacity constraint. Bureau of Indian Standards organizes regular Awareness Programmes through its various Regional Offices/Branch Offices. Many of these awareness programmes are conducted in association with Consumer Organizations. These programmes focus on enhancing quality consciousness of consumers by highlighting issues of Standardization, promotion of BIS Standard Mark, Hallmarking of Gold &#038; Silver and educating them on the misuse of BIS Standard mark &#038; Complaint Redressal System for products with BIS Standard Mark.                      </p>
