The scheme covers NBFCs/HFCs that may have slipped into Special Mention Account-0 category (i.e., repayments in which are up to 30 days past due date) during the one year period prior to 1.8.2018, and asset pools rated &#8220;BBB+&#8221; or higher. The window for one-time partial credit guarantee is open till 30.6.2020 or till such date by which Rs 1,00,000 crore assets get purchased by the banks, whichever is earlier.</p>
