Globally, diabetic retinopathy is estimated to be responsible for 1.3% of visual impairment in the year 2015.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Under the National Programme for Control of Blindness &#038; Visual Impairment (NPCBVI), Diabetic Retinopathy is a priority disease.  Screening for Diabetic Retinopathy has also started in some states of the country.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Information, Education and Communication (IEC) through print, electronic and digital media is an on-going activity under NPCBVI to create mass awareness among the public including diabetics to prevent impairment in vision.  Also, special campaigns are undertaken during the World Sight Day to educate people about the measures to prevent impairment in vision.</p>
