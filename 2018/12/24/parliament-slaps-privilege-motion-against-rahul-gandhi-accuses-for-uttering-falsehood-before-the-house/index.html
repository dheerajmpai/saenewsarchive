<p>&#8220;We categorically assert that the price comparison given by Rahul Gandhi is a figment of imagination, incorrect and utter falsehood. It was an attempt to mislead the House. By uttering falsehood before the House, Rahul Gandhi is guilty of Breach of Privilege of Parliament,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Rahul Gandhi had previously claimed the Rafale deal was signed for Rs 512 Crore under UPA rule while Modi Gov had increased the price to Rs 1500 Crores per plane. Later he also claimed the government had commercial favoritism towards Reliance ADAG which has 1.5% total offset stakes in the Rafale Deal.</p>



<p>Both the claims very dismissed by Supreme court on 14th December when it gave a clean chit for the Modi Government</p>
