<p>At a public

Indian soil by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, the Prime Minister released a
 commemorative postal stamp, coin, and First Day Cover.</p>



<p>He also unveiled a series of development projects related to the energy, connectivity and health sectors.</p>



<p>Speaking on 
the occasion, he said that the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are not just a
 symbol of India&#8217;s natural beauty, but are also like a place of 
pilgrimage for Indians. He said the Andaman and Nicobar Islands remind 
us of the collective resolve of our freedom fighters.</p>

<p>He mentioned 
his visit to the Cellular Jail, and the point where Netaji Subhas 
Chandra Bose had hoisted the tricolour 75 years ago. He said that the 
Cellular Jail, where thousands of freedom fighters suffered, is no less 
than a place of worship for him. He said the nation will never forget 
the sacrifices of the freedom fighters.</p>



<p>Recalling Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, the Prime Minister said that on Netaji&#8217;s call, many youth from the Andamans had dedicated themselves to the freedom of India.

Islands, as self-sufficient as possible. He spoke of the expansion of
