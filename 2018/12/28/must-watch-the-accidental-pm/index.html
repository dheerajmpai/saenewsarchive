<p>It&#8217;s a weird phenomena. 5 years ago the nation had almost everything it <strong>shouldn’t</strong> have. Inflation had reached <strong>10%+</strong>. Corruption had broken all the records. National security had gone for a toss.</p>



<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color">Bofors scam, 2G scam , Sathyam scam, Common Wealth Games scam, Chopper scam, Coal scam, Tatra truck scam, Aadarsh Scam, Boeing Scam, And the list goes on</p>



<p> There was nothing called International relation as the top leaders shunned with zero diplomacy. Farmer’s life were ruined as the Gov was not able to pay the minimum support price.</p>



<p>People protested against the incumbent government and a movement came up(Anna Hazare and Team). With a lot of efforts people puled down the corrupt Government.</p>



<p>Now
 people have forgotten all the bad days. Things are working fine. 
Economy has stabilized. The real GDP has significantly raised. 
Entrepreneurial opportunities have increased due to decreased amount of 
barriers. Minimum support price has raised by 150%. Production has 
increased despite record low inflation.</p>



<p>People find it hard to compare the two and make wise decisions during the elections. And here is where the media comes to rescue.</p>
